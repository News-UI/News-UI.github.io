As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Lauren Dillard, chief communications officer.\n\nLauren Dillard -- Chief Communications Officer\n\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome. Thank you for joining us to discuss our fiscal '20 fourth-quarter and year-end results. With me today are Scott Howe, our CEO; and Warren Jenson, president and CFO; James Arra, president and chief commercial officer, will be participating in the Q&A portion of today's call.\n\nToday's press release and this call may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a detailed description of these risks, please read the Risk Factors section of our public filings in the press release. A copy of our press release and financial schedules, including any reconciliation to non-GAAP financial measures is available at liveramp.com. Also, during the call today, we will be referring to the slide deck posted on our website.\n\nAt this time, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott Howe -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Lauren. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. Let me begin by saying we hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. To say that we are in unprecedented times almost feels clich\u00e9, but we are, and the rapid onset of the COVID-19 pandemic will have far-reaching consequences for months and likely years to come.\n\nThis is a global time unlike any we have faced before. And we are responding by supporting our global employees, customers and partners, and community. Our first priority is always to our people, and I am incredibly proud of how seamlessly our 1,100 employees transitioned to working remote. We are providing our teams with the tools and resources they need to be productive and serve our customers in a work-from-home environment.\n\nWe are doubling down on employee communications, all-hands meetings and virtual events to ensure our people feel supported and connected to their teams. And we are soliciting and responding to employee feedback through ongoing surveys. We held a very successful virtual sales kickoff at the end of last month and have smoothly transitioned our ramp-up on the road events to a series of virtual summits. While it feels as though we haven't missed a beat, we also recognize this is a challenging time for our employees and their families.\n\nAnd I am so inspired by the resilience, grit, and customer obsession our teams have demonstrated. There are silver linings to be found in every crisis. And for LiveRamp, this period has served to strengthen the exceptional culture and character of our company. As a technology partner, we also have a duty to support all our customers and partners as they adjust to these challenging economic conditions by offering products and solutions that help their businesses become more resilient, efficient, and innovative.\n\nNow more than ever, it is important for brands to stay close to their customers and to demonstrate that their marketing investments are driving quantifiable business results. At LiveRamp, we remain committed to providing the critical infrastructure required for companies and their partners to connect, control, and activate data to deliver customer value and drive measurable return on investment. And finally, we have a commitment to our community. And in recent months, we have stepped up our data for good efforts to support organizations that are on the front lines.\n\nFor example, in mid-March, we launched a no-cost initiative to enable healthcare companies to use our products to recruit healthcare workers to telehealth platforms and to reach out to patients with personalized information in a time of national crisis. In addition, we are supporting a variety of local nonprofit organizations in the cities where we have offices. Before turning to the quarter, let me just acknowledge the efforts of all those who are working tirelessly to keep us safe and reopen the economy during this period. Thank you.\n\nA final but important thank you before I transition to discussing the business is to Bill Dillard, who, earlier today, announced he would retire from our board of directors when his term expires in August. Bill is a giant in the business world. As CEO and chairman of Dillard's, he runs one of the biggest retailers in North America. He has incredible business and financial intellect, and he has been a director for LiveRamp and, before that, Acxiom, for more than 30 years.\n\nIn my time as CEO, Bill has been a professional and personal mentor. He even took me to all the best Arkansan barbecue restaurants in my first year at Acxiom. He is amazing, and I can't thank him enough for his years of service. We've already started a search for Bill's board successor, and we're prioritizing SaaS expertise, operating experience, diversity, and deep understanding of the data ecosystem.\n\nSwitching gears now to the quarter. Amidst a challenging macro environment, I am pleased to report we delivered another strong quarter, highlighted by continued top-line execution and improving gross margin trends. Total revenue was $106 million, representing 35% year-over-year growth. Subscription revenue increased 28%, driven by strong usage of our platform to support more destinations and new use cases, including measurement, advanced TV, and second-party data collaboration.\n\nMarketplace and other revenue was up 71%, driven by a record data marketplace quarter. We saw strong growth in third-party data sales in Q4 to support advanced television targeting and our consumer social program. We also closed another solid bookings quarter, following record quarters in Q2 and Q3. Upsell bookings, in particular, were strong, and we had a number of nice safe haven wins, driving our average ACV up.\n\nEnding ARR grew 29% year over year, and our subscription and platform net expansion metrics were a healthy 110% and 122%, respectively. Beneath the top line, we generated significant gross margin leverage in the quarter and remained focused on driving further efficiencies across our entire cost base in the coming year. And finally, we continue to support our shareholders through our buyback. We took advantage of the recent pullback in our stock to pull forward our planned repurchases.\n\nAs a result, we opportunistically bought back over 100 million of stock since December 31. While we are very proud of our strong finish to FY '20, LiveRamp, along with most companies, will be impacted by the pandemic in FY '21. We are carefully monitoring leading indicators and key activity metrics, including pipeline, sales cycle length, conversion rates, contraction and product usage to assess the potential impact this year. We believe in the fundamental strength of our model but will feel pressure in certain areas.\n\nFor example, at the end of last quarter, we began to experience a higher trend in contraction among our smaller customers. This, in addition to some noncontrollable churn events, drove the deceleration in net customer adds in Q4. That said, we are actively pursuing a handful of initiatives to ensure we are delivering world-class customer experience during this time. We recently released several enhancements to our UI and also made significant improvements in reliability and turnaround times, reducing the average turnaround time by as much as 40% in recent months.\n\nWe have also streamlined our customer support structure to get customers faster, higher-quality responses. We are also watching our variable and data marketplace revenue closely. In line with what others in the space are reporting, year-over-year marketplace growth, although positive, trended lower in April as certain advertisers paused campaign spend. However, we are seeing some early signs of stabilization in May.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the macro environment will present some headwinds for our industry and business, we also know that circumstances like these, often bring opportunities. And in the coming months and quarters, we will play from a position of strength by leveraging three core competitive advantages: one, the growing importance of our value proposition; two, our durable business model; and three, our exceptionally strong balance sheet. Let me briefly address each in turn. First, we have an attractive and increasingly important value prop for our customers and partners in this environment.\n\nWhile we would never claim to be immune to the global pullback in advertising, we are fortunate to benefit from the secular wave toward data-driven, performance-based marketing. As budgets shift from above the line to below line, we play a critical role when helping our customers spend smarter and demonstrate clear return on investment. Our product suite and, in particular, solutions like ATS, advanced TV, and Safe Haven helps to ensure every marketing dollar spent is addressable, accountable, and measurable. We continue to experience strong global traction with the authenticated traffic solution or ATS.\n\nIt feels like the industry is rallying around ATS as the solution for a post-cookie world, and we've seen a nice uptick in recent adoption. We currently have 18 SSPs live with or implementing ATS, and we were excited to recently go live with InMobi, our first mobile SSP. On the demand side, we have 35 DSPs bidding on IDL or in the process of implementing, including Amobee, Beeswax, Criteo, and MediaMath. And perhaps most validating is the recent global publisher momentum we've generated.\n\nWe now have people-based integrations with over 30% of the Comscore 50, and have publishers on board in the U.K., France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Australia, and Japan. Continuing to evangelize and drive adoption of ATS will remain a top priority in the coming year. We know this is an area of interest for many of you. So we have included additional resources on our website and plan to host another ATS-focused investor webinar in June.\n\nNext, we believe the last two months have significantly accelerated our opportunity in advanced television. If there were ever to be a tipping point for data-driven television, we are witnessing it. With live sports canceled and the traditional upfronts canceled or postponed, we are seeing a sharp shift in activity to regional buying and CTV, both of which have the opportunity to be data-driven and addressable. Our CTV-related revenues were, again, very strong in the quarter.\n\nAnd our total advanced television business was up well in excess of 50%. As the economy begins to gradually reopen and as TV advertisers reengage, targeting, and in particular, regional targeting and measurement will become more important than ever. We are uniquely positioned to help these advertisers find targeted audiences across addressable television and streaming platforms and measure how those campaigns are driving business outcomes with Data Plus Math. The dramatic shift to streaming and in particular, AVOD streaming services during this time also presents an interesting opportunity for us to help brands find cord cutters and cord nevers where they are now consuming television.\n\nFinally, our Safe Haven solution has also generated tremendous global interest since its official launch this year. The current environment has spurred a moment for the industry to pause and reflect on its current strategies and practices. And as a result, many retailers are looking for ways to modernize their tech stack, which is exactly where Safe Haven comes in. I will let Warren share more on our progress in this area in a moment.\n\nAs Safe Haven was really born out of the innovative work we have been doing internationally with Carrefour and several other leading brands under Warren's leadership, while no one can predict exactly when we will see a recovery or what it will look like, what we do know is that data-driven advertising has an important role to play today, and an even bigger one as advertisers begin to strategize how they emerge on the other side of this pandemic. Second, we have a durable business model and diversified customer base. In recent quarters, there has been some debate around whether LiveRamp is true SaaS or ad tech. We hope our performance during this period serves to take that debate off the table.\n\nWhile peers in the ad tech space are forecasting sharp year-over-year revenue declines, we are forecasting growth. LiveRamp is enterprise SaaS, and we generate recurring subscription revenue, approximately 80% of our revenue comes from subscription contracts and more than 70% of our committed revenue or RPO is tied to multiyear deals. This provides us more stability than most as we navigate this period. We are also fortunate to have a diversified customer base with approximately 780 direct subscription customers, expanding a variety of verticals and geographies.\n\nExposure to the most impacted industries, like travel, hospitality, and entertainment, is highly manageable. And for these customers, we are developing a series of hit-the-ground-running packages, designed to help ready their data and capabilities for a quick restart when the economy stabilizes. Finally, we have an incredibly strong balance sheet. With more than $700 million in cash and no debt at year-end, we are fortunate to have the flexibility to continue to invest in product innovation and our key growth initiatives while also making bold investments to secure our future growth.\n\nIn the coming year, we intend to aggressively invest in the continued platformization of our infrastructure in our key future growth initiatives like television and Safe Haven. In addition, our strong financial position enables us to explore smart and strategic acquisitions and partnerships. Like the partnership we announced with Comscore a couple of weeks ago, which we believe is a game-changer for outcome-based television measurement. This preferred partnership provides customers access to Comscore's unified television viewership data, spending tens of millions of addressable households for outcome-based measurement through Data Plus Math and additional activation and measurement use cases through Safe Haven.\n\nIn short, it means that an advertiser running an advanced television campaign now has even more options available for measurement, segment creation, and understanding business outcomes. We are very excited to team up with Comscore to bring these combined capabilities to market. To conclude, I'll end where I began. We are in unprecedented times, and we expect this pandemic to have lasting effects on how companies do business now and in the future.\n\nBut as Warren and I have often said, data usage is only growing in importance. During periods of great uncertainty, leaders lead, and we will navigate the coming months and quarters from a position of strength. We play a critical role in helping companies deliver relevant and meaningful experiences to consumers. We have a set of products designed to deliver immediate value to customers by enabling their marketing spend to be addressable, accountable, and measurable.\n\nWe have a recurring subscription business model, diverse customer base, and a strong balance sheet which provides us flexibility to drive innovation and invest for long-term growth. And importantly, we have a nimble and resilient culture and a team of global LiveRampers who are up for the challenge. With that, thanks again for joining us today, and a big thank you to our exceptional customers, partners, and employees for their ongoing support and hard work. I'll now turn the call over to Warren.\n\nWarren Jenson -- President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Before jumping in, I, too, would like to thank our associates for their awesome work over the last several weeks. I feel fortunate to work with such great people.\n\nI also hope that all is well for each of you and your families. I'd like to focus my remarks today on four areas: first, briefly talk about Q4, highlighting the strength of our position going into this downturn; next, share a few performance highlights from April and the first two weeks of May, in other words, what we're seeing right now, then share a few high-level observations about FY '21; and finally, our Q1 guidance. Q4 results, LiveRamp's position of strength. Please turn to Slide 4.\n\nWell, in short, we entered this crisis with considerable momentum and from a position of strength. Almost every critical metric was up close to or over 30%. Q4 revenue was up 35%, subscription revenue, up 28%. Bookings grew by 31%.\n\nCurrent RPO or our next 12-month backlog was up 29%. And ARR ended the year up 29%. And notably, marketplace was up 71%, driven by the strength of our performance in TV. Net retention was 110% and platform net retention was a strong 122%.\n\nOur growth initiatives are on a roll in setting the pace for innovation globally. LiveRamp Safe Haven. Earlier this year, we launched our Safe Haven platform, and we've been winning globally. This calendar year, we've entered into Safe Haven partnerships with over 10 leading global brands, including another top five U.S.\n\nretailer, one of the largest pharma companies in the world; carwow, the leading online automotive marketplace in the U.K.; and MiQ, a programmatic media platform in China. In addition, TV had a standout quarter. TV-related revenues were up over 70% year over year. Operationally, it was also a great quarter as our gross margin exceeded 70% for the first time as a stand-alone business.\n\nWe have now fully absorbed our extra public company infrastructure costs. Interestingly, in the U.S., our gross margin was 73%, which is very close to our long-term model commitment. Our operating loss was $16 million. As part of our year-end close, we scrubbed our balance sheet and added approximately $3.5 million in incremental bad debt reserves to cover potential COVID-related challenges.\n\nOf our total expenses, approximately $10 million was largely onetime in nature. And lastly, we ended the year with a very strong balance sheet. Our cash balance was $718 million, and we have no debt. We've been through our receivables with a fine-tooth comb, and we feel our exposures are appropriately reserved.\n\nWe were careful over the last few months, but at the same time, we're opportunistic with our buyback. And as a result, we took the opportunity to front-end load our FY '21 repurchases. Calendar year to date, we have repurchased 3.1 million shares for total consideration of $103 million. Since inception of our buyback, we have returned approximately $1.2 billion to our shareholders.\n\nIn summary, we ended FY '20 in an incredibly strong position. We are in the middle of a powerful secular growth curve and have a great set of customers, employees, and products. Our lagging and leading performance metrics are strong, and our products are winning. We are helping to power this secular trend toward outcome-driven advertising and addressability.\n\nAnd finally, we have a balance sheet that is the envy of the industry. But as we all know, that was then. So what are we seeing now? For the next several minutes, I'll focus my comments on three areas. First, metrics.\n\nWhat are the numbers telling us? Next, what have we done to manage the crisis and ensure we will lead and win in economic recovery? And finally, share our perspective on FY '21 and provide guidance for Q1. Metrics. What are the numbers telling us? Please turn to Slide 13, Industry Concentration and Customer Concessions. First, we are SaaS.\n\nAnd as a result, our revenues are highly durable. As this chart shows, our client mix is also diverse. As you would expect, we have worked with our customers who have been severely impacted. For those customers, in some cases, we have temporarily paused our service and billing for a short period of time, usually about three months.\n\nTypically, that accommodation has also included a contract extension. To date, concessions have been highly manageable and have totaled about 4 million revenue and have been factored into the guidance we will share later on this call. In summary, our client mix is diverse, and our SaaS revenue is resilient. And while things could always change, customer concessions have been manageable.\n\nApril results, please turn to Slide 14. In short, we grew. Subscription, marketplace, and ARR all improved year over year. We continue to win and close business.\n\nFurther, we have seen no deterioration in the records being uploaded into our platform. In fact, our volumes indexed against the first 10 weeks of the calendar year were up in April and for the first two weeks of May. However, the usage portion of our subscription revenue as a percentage of total subscription revenue did decline compared to the prior year. Typically, the variable portion has averaged between 10% and 15% of total subscription revenue.\n\nFor the month of April and the first two weeks of May, variable is averaging low to mid-single digits. As a percentage of total subscription revenue. Net, while down as a percentage of revenue, we continue to see usage from customers in excess of their committed minimums. Before talking about our approach to and outlook for FY '21, I'd like to share a few of the challenges we are seeing.\n\nWhile we are obviously thrilled with the resiliency of our platform and the reception of our products, we would be the last to argue that our business is not being impacted by the downturn. It has been and is. Specifically, we would highlight that we have seen pipeline push out. Make no mistake, we're still closing deals, but deal cycles are extending.\n\nNext, we expect our net new customer adds to slow considerably as a result of higher churn and fewer new deals closing in this environment. We felt some of this pressure in late March. It is conceivable that we may have a quarter where our net adds are flat to down. We expect our results internationally to continue to be pressured.\n\nNext, we expect our retention metrics to be pressured for the reasons mentioned above, and it's very possible that there will be more requests to put our service on hold, particularly in industries where recovery will lag. In summary, we feel very fortunate to be the category creator and innovator in a business which is benefiting from a powerful secular trend. We are Switzerland, and the industry needs a neutral identity infrastructure, our products drive real results. This is more important than ever during this critical time.\n\nWe're SaaS, and the resiliency of our subscription business is clear. And finally, we are clearly feeling -- while we are clearly feeling the impact of macro forces, we have and are managing the impact. In short, we are still growing. I would now like to spend a minute and share our approach to the macro challenges.\n\nAs many of you know, I was Amazon's CFO in the company's early days. 20 years ago, the markets and press turned on Amazon, pretty sure it was The Wall Street Journal who came out with the headline, Amazon.bomb, the stock went to $7. That said, Amazon had a unique advantage and challenge. Its customers love the service, but the company was bleeding hundreds of millions, and absent change was a goner.\n\nIt seems hard to believe today, but true. History now tells the rest. In those start days, Amazon became free cash flow positive but simultaneously drove massive innovation. Used goods were sold next to new.\n\nThe company entered into platform joint ventures with Toys \"R\" Us and Target. And as a result, the origins of AWS were seeded. Its fulfillment centers became an asset as third-party merchants could use Amazon's infrastructure and sell next to Amazon's owned inventory. What seldom discussed though was how buttoned-up Amazon became.\n\nIn short order, every operational process got good. My words, Amazon got control of the knobs, really, really fast. And 20 years later, the rest is history. So what have we been up to at LiveRamp? As the world around has changed, our leadership team gathered virtually in mid-March and set some objectives and guardrails for replanning the company's coming months and quarters.\n\nSpecifically, we would protect the health and well-being of our employees and our company's culture, delight our customers, and focus on their needs, deal with the new realities and move quickly to take action. And finally, take steps to ensure we would protect our business in the short term, but also win in recovery. Specifically, on the top line, double down on new initiatives like ATS, TV, and Safe Haven. And on the bottom line, tighten up our operational processes to accelerate our drive toward operational excellence, profitability, and margin expansion.\n\nPlease turn to Slide 16. This page summarizes the financials associated with eight weeks of focused planning and activity across every function of LiveRamp. We built detailed plans for accelerating our investments in ATS, TV, Safe Haven, and B2B. These investments will mostly show up in R&D.\n\nNext, we have built strategies to boost productivity in every functional area of the company. As an example, as a result of changing work practices, we don't intend to add any new lease space this coming year. We have also retooled our quote-to-cash practices. And where we had opportunity, we went after reducing discretionary spend.\n\nIn short, we're excited and leaning in. We have protected innovation and are doubling down on some big opportunities, and at the same time, have dramatically brought in our profitability time line. I'd like to close by summarizing our thoughts on FY '21 and then provide specific guidance for Q1. Please turn to Slide 15.\n\nWhile we don't intend to give traditional full-year guidance, we wanted to summarize the positives, the challenges and the likely implications. Our net takeaways are on the right. Secular trends are in our favor. We expect FY '21 will be a growth year, albeit modest.\n\nGiven what we see today, we expect meaningful profit improvement and manageable cash burn. Our balance sheet and liquidity are secure. And finally, the importance of our platform and products puts us in a great position to win and accelerate in economic recovery. For Q1, we expect revenue of approximately $88 million and a non-GAAP operating loss of up to $12 million.\n\nPlease keep in mind that this guidance excludes intangibles, stock-based compensation, and restructuring and related charges. A few other call-outs. In Q1, our guidance is intended to be conservative, but it is also appropriate. Given the sequential decline in revenue, we would expect gross margin to be down sequentially.\n\nWe expect approximately $6 million of restructuring and related spend and $1 million of capex. Finally, for the year, a few additional items. Buyback. Given the market dislocation, we purposely front end-loaded our repurchases.\n\nTherefore, we do not expect to be in the market for the remainder of the calendar year. That said, we will not hesitate to be opportunistic should circumstances warrant. Note that during the year, we expect to receive a tax refund of approximately $30 million as a result of being able to carry back our FY '20 tax losses. Other full-year guidance items have been included on Slide '19.\n\nBefore opening the call to questions, I'll close with a few final thoughts. First, again, a huge thank you to our customers and employees. It is you who make this company great. Next, we are approaching the coming months and quarters from a position of considerable strength.\n\nWe are SaaS and our revenues are resilient. We sit at the center of a strong secular trend and have taken steps to deliver a solid top and bottom-line performance through the downturn and are investing and tightening to ensure we lead in recovery too. It's a great time to be at LiveRamp. With that, operator, we will open the call to questions.\n\nQuestions & Answers:\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nDan Salmon -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I've got one for Scott, one for Warren. Scott, I'd be curious just to hear a little bit more of the nuance on your conversations with clients if we can sort of remove the effect of the pandemic if that's possible.\n\nAnd what the tone of conversations is with clients around some of the key issues that were driving adoption of your products previously, including, obviously, the challenges to third-party cookies and particularly the notice that a lot more people tended to take once Chrome made their announcement regarding that. So I'd love to just hear what the conversation is broadly around where those priorities still lie. And then, Warren, I understand the fiscal '21 guidance of albeit modest growth, I guess when we see that and compare it against the plus 14% in April, I guess it's fair to say that where some of these negatives around, especially, say, pipeline, pushing out in some concessions are driving something that we would expect to be below the April rate. Is that how we should take modest to be? Thank you.\n\nScott Howe -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nSo, Dan, it's Scott. I'll start but also invite James. James Arra is on the call with us as well, and so he can probably provide some real anecdotal color around what I'm about to say. So what I would tell you is there is a real headwind from COVID, but also a real silver lining.\n\nAnd certainly, the economy is in a different period, different state than it was just three short months ago. And we absolutely work with some clients who are hard hit by that. Travel, retail, automotive, they have been hard hit, and you can see it in, in particular, their television investments, their broadcast television investments. I mean, they really pulled back.\n\nBut within that backdrop, I think all of our clients have found that they have a little bit of breathing room to stop and think as opposed to just execute, execute, execute. And so the conversations around third-party cookie deprecation and their response have certainly accelerated. We especially see that from publishers. I think there was kind of a misperception in the industry that the authenticated traffic solution was a replacement for third-party cookies.\n\nNow it's not an or. It's an and. That even before third-party cookies go away, publishers who embrace ATS can make what was 40% of their inventory that was previously unaddressable through Safari or Firefox, they can actually lock in significantly higher yields, I mean, 20% more. And so as a result, those conversations have really found wings.\n\nOur direct clients also, as they think about what spend remains and what additional spend they'll activate as they come out of the recession, they're really focused on measurability and ROI, and those two characteristics really play to our strengths. So we were talking earlier, we tend to be the last one to leave and the first one back, meaning that when clients turn off their efforts. The direct accountable stuff is the last thing that they'll ever want to touch, and it's the first thing that they want to reactivate coming out of a downturn. And so that spurred additional conversations for us and things like connected television, where clients realize there's no upfront, behavior has shifted in-home behind screens and the only way to reach young people is through connected television, the likes which we can provide.\n\nMoreover, because we have a data set that allows them to buy far more granularly than GRPs or TRPs, they can actually target their audience more effectively. So a lot of good opportunities for us to go mine in this downturn.\n\nWarren Jenson -- President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nAnd then, Dan, the higher...\n\nJames Arra -- President and Chief Commercial Officer\n\nDan, this is...\n\nWarren Jenson -- President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nJames, go ahead.\n\nJames Arra -- President and Chief Commercial Officer\n\nSure. Thanks, Warren. Dan, just to give you some client anecdotes because clearly, the COVID shutdown is having an impact that no one could have predicted a few months ago. But our conversations with our clients have always been around two primary themes, and that's addressability and measurability.\n\nAnd the interesting thing we saw at the end of last quarter and then even in April is if we are seeing some pipeline push, we're also seeing some of our companies look to this as an opportunity to really think about what to do once they're out of the COVID shutdown. And there's two examples I want to give you. One is with a fantasy sports platform. And we thought, for sure, our deal at the end of last quarter would be dead in the water.\n\nBut we were able to show them that once we get through this period, here's all the things they need to do. And they ended up signing a deal at the end of the quarter, so we were really pleased with that. And that's an example of a company thinking about what happens after the shutdown. And another one is in the QSR space.\n\nWe signed a new logo deal, a seven-figure deal with one of the major QSR companies out there. And they're clearly not as impacted by the COVID period, but they are using this as an opportunity to really think about the strategy and think about how to drive to more of a data-driven approach, how to drive to more measurability and more addressability. So there's certainly a lot of silver linings in what's happening. And we really believe strongly, we're well-positioned to help our customers through the recession and to really recession-proof their businesses.\n\nWarren Jenson -- President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nAnd Dan, this is Warren. Let me chat a little bit about our guidance. First, let me just start off by saying we were incredibly pleased by what we saw in April and the resiliency of our business across the board. As you would expect, however, we, like you, were watching everything very, very carefully, and, in particular, wanting the variable portion of subscription revenue and marketplace.\n\nSo what about our guidance? A couple of things I want to mention. First, as I did in my prepared remarks, we intended our guidance to be conservative. And let me just kind of put another phrase around that. We wanted to give you guidance you can take to the bank.\n\nAnd I'm going to mention three things. First of all, overall, revenues will be up for the year. Subscription revenue will be up for the year, and we expect profitability improvement. So again, we fully intended the guidance to be conservative, be conservative.\n\nAnd secondly, guidance you can take to the bank.\n\nDan Salmon -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Stan Zlotsky with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open now.\n\nStan Zlotsky -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nThank you so much. Hey, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for taking my questions. First one for me, the Connected TV business, we're certainly hearing a lot about it in the industry news with the upfronts going away, as you mentioned. How are you thinking about this business? And whether this really could -- the COVID, as terrible as the whole thing is, maybe this could be a massive shift that finally pushes the whole industry away from the legacy way in which TV advertising was bought and really push it to this connected TV and digital buying.\n\nAnd then I have a quick follow-up.\n\nScott Howe -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. Stan, it's Scott. So Connected TV for us was up very, very strongly in Q4, and we expect it to have another very strong double-digit growth year in FY '21. I do think this is as close to a tipping point as we'll see.\n\nThings are starting to move. I think the first harbinger for us is just the sheer number of client conversations that we fielded. And yes, it's picked up, perhaps in the last couple of months. However, these were strong over the last six to eight months that this trend was already coming.\n\nThe other thing that I mentioned briefly in my prepared remarks, but one of the advantages that we have as a company right now is we do feel like we have a really strong balance sheet. And that's going to allow us to be very strategic in commercial deals as well. And so one of the things we announced in the last couple of weeks was our deal with Comscore. In the television space, there are kind of two things that really matter: number one is addressability, the ability to identify who's living behind a set-top box, and that's something that we've long prided ourselves on the ability to do, but the other piece of that is viewership.\n\nWhat are they watching? And through the Comscore commercial deal that they announced on their earnings call a couple of weeks ago, we have licensed viewership data for a really significant number of households. I mean, when you talk about both set-top box and connected television, we are talking upwards of 80 million or 90 million devices. So that really, I think, allows us to bring scale to the conversations we have and really offer a compelling value proposition to our advertisers. So all this to say we're really excited about what's to come here.\n\nStan Zlotsky -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nGot it. And then just a follow-up. On the expansion and -- well, actually, I guess the flip side -- the contraction, rather, that you're seeing within your existing customers, maybe help us to break it down between the 22% of your ARR that's really coming from these heavily impacted industries and what you're seeing there. Is the contraction there, is it like full stop, we're stopping everything? Or is it maybe just a slight pullback? And then the other 78% of your business and what the contraction looks like on the other side.\n\nThat's it for me. Thank you.\n\nScott Howe -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nJames, do you want to...\n\nJames Arra -- President and Chief Commercial Officer\n\nStan, this is James. Yes. I'll go ahead and take this. So let me start by saying Q4 was a really good quarter, and as Scott mentioned in his prepared remarks, it was our third-largest bookings quarter ever.\n\nAnd similar to other quarters for FY '20, roughly 65-ish percent of that was an upsell, so we are still seeing significant growth within our customer base. Now what we experienced toward the end of Q4 and what we're being very cautious of in our guidance for FY '21 is we did see a number of very small clients, sub-$50,000-a-year clients pull back, and we saw churn from there. The other thing we saw was some noncontrollable churn. There was some major acquisitions that have happened where both of our clients, both side to our clients.\n\nSo we saw that impact to a certain extent and then some bankruptcies and some nonpayment. We saw that tick up quite substantially in Q4 as well. So all that being said, we're always looking for ways we can provide more value to our customers, and we'll continue to do that. And we've always said that that churn is an opportunity for us.\n\nAnd we're really looking for ways that we can continue to drive more value. Now the COVID impact specific to the 22% that we outlined, there, what we are seeing is them ask for concessions, and we're being a good partner. And we recognize that they're going through some very, very tough times right now, and we're working with them as they shut things down right now. But we don't view this as a situation for the companies that survive this, and we think many of our customers will.\n\nWe don't necessarily view that COVID shutdown as a churn event. In fact, just earlier today, a major hotel chain that two months ago, had asked us to pause because they were shutting down everything and furloughing employees. They came back to us today and said, they're starting back up. We were expecting the conversation to be, hey, we're going to need another month or we're going to do another two months, and it was the opposite.\n\nThey're already gearing up for the reopening. So we're viewing that as a really positive sign.\n\nStan Zlotsky -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nThank you so much.\n\nScott Howe -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nBrian Fitzgerald -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\n\nThanks, guys. I wanted to drill down just a little bit more on the mechanics of that lower usage. Is it fewer campaigns, fewer segments, customers using fewer touchpoints, or just the impact of, to your point, clients who are pulling back very hard on advertising? And any broad trends or themes to tease out there, how quickly you see that bouncing back as we exit? Thanks.\n\nJames Arra -- President and Chief Commercial Officer\n\nWell, yes, I'll start. And then Warren, why don't you weigh in with some of the macro metrics that we're seeing. So for the customers that have requested a pause and really, this is a concession that we're giving. It's really due to the fact that they've either completely shut off all marketing and, in many situations, have furloughed employees because of the shutdown, where there's just no reason for them to be spending that money.\n\nBut we're staying engaged with these customers. We're being a good partner. And what we're also doing is we're helping them build their start-up plans. So Scott mentioned this in his remarks as well.\n\nOnce we get out of sort of COVID-shutdown mode, there is going to be a meaningful recession. And we strongly believe we can help our customers through recession because budgets are going to be constrained and what they're going to need to maximize the value they get out of every marketing dollar they spend. And the way they do that is through measurability and addressability. And that's the areas that we really help them with.\n\nSo for many of these customers that are on pause, we're staying engaged. We're working with them on their plans for how to restart and what they should focus on. And we believe that will help them and will help us accelerate out of this very quickly.\n\nWarren Jenson -- President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nA couple of things, Brian, that I'd mentioned that are also -- I guess one thing very specific to the numbers and then a couple of things anecdotally. It was really interesting. A large global consumer brand that spends, I don't know how many hundreds, if not billions, of dollars on advertising came to us about 30 days ago, and they said, \"We have pulled back 80% of our advertising globally, but we have also made the decision that when we come back, we are going to come back with 100% addressability.\" So we are working with this brand on putting them in a position to do exactly that. And that's the sort of thing that we're seeing from our customers.\n\nThe second thing is that, obviously, as it comes to usage for April and for the first two weeks of May, we said low to mid-single digits, so call it, 4% or 5%. So it is down from 10% to 15%, but it's still positive and would argue, at least for now, it's certainly, certainly stable. And then one other interesting specific. In terms of the concessions we've given to people, as I noted in the call, and I'll just repeat it.\n\nTypically, they're 30 to 90 days. And then also, for the vast majority of those, we also extended our clients so -- or extended our contracts. So it was very much just a pause. And over -- I think, James, wasn't it over 70% of those requests came in the first 10 days or so of April? So this was very much front end-loaded, and we just have not seen any kind of volume like that over the course of really, the last four weeks.\n\nJames Arra -- President and Chief Commercial Officer\n\nYeah, that's exactly right.\n\nBrian Fitzgerald -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\n\nThanks, James. Thanks, Warren. Thanks, Scott.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Shyam Patil with Susquehanna. Your line is open.\n\nShyam Patil -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for all the transparency and color. I wanted to ask a few questions or a couple of questions around the marketplace business. It seems like it's trending much better than what we've seen for programmatic spend.\n\nAnd I was just curious why you think that is. And when you look at just the programmatic display portion of that business, are you seeing any changes in terms of data elements per campaign, less uses there? And then, Warren, in your fiscal-year expectations, just in your base case, how are you thinking about just the marketplace line? Thank you.\n\nScott Howe -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nSo Shyam, it's Scott. First off, on the marketplace business. Remember that if you think about the customers of our data marketplace business, it's actually fairly broad. Yes, we work with direct brands, but we also work with some of the large platform and tech providers.\n\nAnd importantly, when they're ingesting data through our data marketplace, they're using it to enhance their own products. So it's not just for programmatic. It can be for programmatic. It can be for television.\n\nBut in many cases, it's even more broad than that. I think there's going to be a real benefit in the coming year for us with television because to the extent that an advertiser feels that just buying thin demographic sets on broadcast television that no one's watching anymore is kind of a tired approach. Well, they can actually utilize Data Plus Math to go find a much more granular audience, so we think that will be an enabler for that business over time. That said, it is the one area because it's variable, much of it is not subscription that we think will be most impacted by the recession, and so we put in place a conservative forecast.\n\nIn terms of the data elements that people are buying the mix, it's not something I know off the top of my head, but we'll look at that and let you know. I mean, we certainly have good line of sight to that.\n\nWarren Jenson -- President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nAnd then in terms of our guidance or just our outlook for the year, I'd probably just repeat a little bit of what Scott said. We're, again, very pleased by what we've seen in April and what we've seen, really, month to date in May. That said, just given all the uncertainty, this is one of the areas that we're watching throughout the year. And we've tried to be appropriately conservative in our internal outlook such that we rightsize everything, but at the same time, we're optimistic but also cautious.\n\nShyam Patil -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question comes from Kyle Evans with Stephens. Your line is open.\n\nKyle Evans -- Stephens Inc. -- Analyst\n\nThanks. Scott, you mentioned that ATS was causing some of your constituents to rally around as kind of a solution in a post-cookie world. Could you talk about what you've seen geographically? I know there are other countries that have higher exposure to Safari and Firefox. I was wondering if that was a good kind of leading indicator for what we would expect from the rest of the world going forward.\n\nScott Howe -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, Warren runs our international business. Do you want to talk about that?\n\nWarren Jenson -- President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nGo ahead and jump in. I'll follow-up.\n\nScott Howe -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nOK. I mean, in my prepared remarks, I talked about just this, the traction we have gotten outside the U.S. I think we've signed double-digit international publishers in the last quarter as an example. And in certain markets, particularly in Europe and much of Asia, this is the only solution for publishers.\n\nI mean, they have even more stringent privacy regulations that they need to navigate. And so it's just so important that they go out and rather than rely on someone else to sit as the intermediary and potentially disintermediate them, that they collect their own authentications, their own consents. Any publisher who has compelling content is already offering a value exchange, and it's just making it from being an implicit value exchange to explicit. And as soon as they do that, as soon as they collect those consents and literally upload a wider code on their page to benefit from ATS, then they can start to generate significant advantages and monetization.\n\nOur initial tests have suggested that could be 20% or more. And obviously, in markets that have the most adoption of Safari and Firefox or the most exposure to Chrome, the yield is going to be even greater and the urgency to adopt something like ATS will increase. So as a result, a lot of traction. I think the biggest challenge for us is how to evangelize that without getting on airplanes, but our team has done a really great job of hosting vid con sessions, webinars, and we have a lot of content on our site if you're interested in learning more.\n\nWarren Jenson -- President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nKyle, let me add a couple of things to what Scott said that really excites us from an international and global perspective. I'd just remind everybody that ATS is not a U.S. thing, it's a global thing. So it is truly a global product offering for LiveRamp.\n\nAnd when you think about our acceleration in recovery, this really globalizes our company much, much more quickly. We have momentum with ATS in Japan. We have momentum with ATS in Australia. We have momentum in Italy and Germany, France, U.K.\n\nand keep going, in Spain. So this is a global phenomenon, and it is a global phenomenon with brands. Many of the largest advertisers in the world, again, are not simply U.S. companies.\n\nThey're global companies. And they want uniform addressability in every single market in which they operate, and that's a very, very positive thing for us. The second thing that I'd note for everybody that has had time to sit down and work with us and hear about what we're doing with our Safe Haven platform. ATS and Safe Haven are very natural partners, and they're natural partners for brands and their natural partners for publishers, which, again, accelerates our opportunity.\n\nAnd again, when you think about Safe Haven, it just revolutionizes how companies collaborate. And it was also built in a privacy-first way. It was built for GDPR. So the combination of those two things, really, we believe, speak.\n\nAnd in fact, the results are showing it, bode well for us globally over not only the near term but also very much so as the world moves on from this crisis.\n\nKyle Evans -- Stephens Inc. -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd that is all the time that we have for questions. I turn the call back to Warren Jenson for any closing remarks.\n\nWarren Jenson -- President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nGreat. Well, thank you, operator. And again, a huge thank you to everyone for joining us today. And most importantly, I'd like to repeat something I said in my prepared remarks, just a huge thank you to our customers and our employees.\n\nIt's you who make this company great. I'd like to conclude with, I guess, just a few thoughts as you think about the year ahead and what we've talked about today. We will grow in FY '21, and our subscription revenue will grow in FY '21. When we think about momentum in the near term and we think about momentum and recovery, our products are winning, whether it's TV, whether it's Safe Haven, whether it's ATS.\n\nWe believe we've given you guidance that you can take to the bank with profitability improvement. And then as always, for everyone, just as we've done this past year, we will be highly strategic with our capital. And let me put it this way. In the near term, and on anything discretionary, we will be very stringy, but also, we intend to be very strategic.\n\nSo with that, thank you all very much for joining us. We look forward to speaking with you over the coming days. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator signoff]\n\nDuration: 65 minutes\n\nCall participants:\n\nLauren Dillard -- Chief Communications Officer\n\nScott Howe -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nWarren Jenson -- President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nDan Salmon -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nJames Arra -- President and Chief Commercial Officer\n\nStan Zlotsky -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nBrian Fitzgerald -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst\n\nShyam Patil -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst\n\nKyle Evans -- Stephens Inc. -- Analyst\n\nMore RAMP analysis\n\nAll earnings call transcripts"}, "News 3": {"title": "The LiveRamp Holdings, Inc.

It looks like the results were pretty good overall. While revenues of US$381m were in line with analyst predictions, statutory losses were much smaller than expected, with LiveRamp Holdings losing US$1.84 per share. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year.\n\nSee our latest analysis for LiveRamp Holdings\n\nNYSE:RAMP Past and Future Earnings May 24th 2020 More\n\nTaking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for LiveRamp Holdings from ten analysts is for revenues of US$419.5m in 2021 which, if met, would be a decent 10% increase on its sales over the past 12 months. Losses are expected to increase substantially, hitting US$2.09 per share. Before this earnings announcement, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$433.8m and losses of US$1.45 per share in 2021. While this year's revenue estimates dropped there was also a loss per share expectations, suggesting the consensus has a bit of a mixed view on the stock.\n\nThe average price target was broadly unchanged at US$51.09, perhaps implicitly signalling that the weaker earnings outlook is not expected to have a long-term impact on the valuation. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. The most optimistic LiveRamp Holdings analyst has a price target of US$63.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$25.00. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business.\n\nOf course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. One thing stands out from these estimates, which is that LiveRamp Holdings is forecast to grow faster in the future than it has in the past, with revenues expected to grow 10%. If achieved, this would be a much better result than the 26% annual decline over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 11% per year. So it looks like LiveRamp Holdings is expected to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most important thing to take away is that the analysts increased their loss per share estimates for next year. They also downgraded their revenue estimates, although as we saw earlier, forecast growth is only expected to be about the same as the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$51.09, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.\n\nKeeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider. We have forecasts for LiveRamp Holdings going out to 2025, and you can see them free on our platform here.\n\nStory continues"}, "News 4": {"title": "LiveRamp Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year Results", "keywords": ["nongaap", "fiscal", "quarter", "announces", "fourth", "revenue", "compared", "results", "loss", "prior", "operating", "liveramp", "cash", "nm", "million"], "publish_date": "2020-05-21", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/liveramp-announces-fourth-quarter-fiscal-200500974.html", "summary": "GAAP operating loss was $41 million compared to a GAAP operating loss of $82 million in the prior year period.\nNon-GAAP operating loss was $16 million compared to a non-GAAP operating loss of $22 million in the prior year period.\nGAAP loss per share from continuing operations was $0.07, and non-GAAP loss per share from continuing operations was $0.05.\nGAAP operating loss was $181 million compared to a GAAP operating loss of $198 million in the prior year.\nNon-GAAP operating loss was $64 million compared to a non-GAAP operating loss of $54 million in the prior year.", "text": "Total Q4 Revenue Up 35% \u2014 Subscription Revenue Up 28%\n\nRepurchases $103 Million of Stock Since December 31, 2019\n\nStrong Balance Sheet\n\nLiveRamp\u00ae (NYSE: RAMP), the leading global data connectivity platform, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.\n\nThis press release features multimedia.

That said, we are fortunate to be operating from a position of strength,\" said LiveRamp President and CFO Warren Jenson. \"In addition to our robust balance sheet, we have great customers, dedicated employees, a subscription business model and products that benefit from the secular wave toward outcome-based marketing and advertising. However, we are watching and monitoring our business closely, and in particular, usage trends and our Data Marketplace.\"\n\nLiveRamp has taken proactive steps to keep its employees safe and global customer base serviced during these unprecedented times:\n\nIn early March, LiveRamp, in coordination with local government guidance, began implementing its Pandemic Plan for staged movement to work from home in order to protect its workforce. The vast majority of LiveRamp\u2019s global employees have seamlessly transitioned to working remotely.\n\nGiven the SaaS nature of its model, LiveRamp does not depend on any on-premise components or personnel for the products and services it provides. LiveRamp is, however, dependent on its cloud infrastructure and the ability for its workforce to work remotely. To date, service to customers and partners has continued uninterrupted.\n\nLiveRamp\u2019s balance sheet remains exceptionally strong, with over $700 million of cash and no debt at year-end. The company is carefully managing working capital, tightening its hiring practices and reducing costs where appropriate.\n\nThe company increased its reserves for bad debts during the fourth quarter by approximately $3.5 million in response to increased future collection risk associated with certain customer segments.\n\nGAAP and Non-GAAP Results\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company\u2019s financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ($ in millions):\n\nQ4 Fiscal 2020 Full Year Fiscal 2020 Results Results GAAP Non-GAAP GAAP Non-GAAP Subscription revenue $84 \u2014 $306 \u2014 YoY change % 28% 29% Marketplace & other revenue $22 \u2014 $75 \u2014 YoY change % 71% 53% Total revenue $106 \u2014 $381 \u2014 YoY change % 35% 33% Gross profit $69 $75 $228 $253 % Gross margin 65% 71% 60% 67% YoY change, pts 13pts 11pts 2pts 1pts Operating loss ($41) ($16) ($181) ($64) % Operating margin (39%) (15%) (48%) (17%) YoY change, pts 66pts 14pts 22pts 2pts Net loss from continuing operations ($5) ($3) ($125) ($37) YoY change % nm nm nm nm Loss per share from continuing operations ($0.07) ($0.05) ($1.85) ($0.55) YoY change % nm nm nm nm Shares to Calculate EPS 67.0 67.0 67.8 67.8 YoY change % (2%) (2%) (10%) (10)% Net operating cash flow ($0) \u2014 ($29) \u2014 YoY change % nm \u2014 nm Free cash flow to equity \u2014 ($2) \u2014 ($40) YoY change % \u2014 nm \u2014 nm Totals may not sum due to rounding.\n\nA detailed discussion of our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in the schedules to this press release.\n\nAdditional Business Metrics & Highlights\n\nLiveRamp added 10 net new direct subscription customers during the quarter, bringing its total direct customer count to 780, an increase of 17% year over year. It now serves 22% of the Fortune 500 compared to 19% in the prior year period.\n\nLiveRamp has 53 clients whose subscription contracts exceed $1 million in annual revenue, up from 46 in the prior year period.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter, subscription net retention was approximately 110%. Platform net retention was 122% driven by strong Marketplace & Other trends.\n\nCurrent remaining performance obligations (RPO), which is contracted and committed revenue expected to be recognized over the next 12 months, was $221 million, up 29% compared to the fourth quarter of last year.\n\nThe company recently launched LiveRamp Safe Haven, a new platform that enables secure, permission-enabled data collaboration for brands and their partners. Two of the top five largest U.S. retailers are implementing Safe Haven, and to date, more than 35 companies world-wide are using this technology in their workflows.\n\nLiveRamp addressability solutions, including ATS, continue to experience strong global adoption. There are currently 18 supply-side platforms (SSPs) live or committed to implementing IdentityLink\u2122 in the bidstream, including OpenX, Index Exchange, Pubmatic, Rubicon Project and TripleLift. In addition, there are 35 demand-side platforms (DSPs) live or committed to bid on IdentityLink, including Amobee, Criteo, dataxu, and MediaMath. Lastly, to date, LiveRamp has signed on more than 45 publishers globally for ATS, spanning the US, UK, France, Spain, Italy, and Japan.\n\nBoard of Directors Update\n\nLiveRamp also announced today that William T. Dillard II is retiring from the LiveRamp Board of Directors when his current term ends at the next annual meeting of shareholders, expected to be held in August 2020. Mr. Dillard has been a trusted advisor during the company\u2019s evolution.\n\n\"Bill\u2019s guidance has been invaluable to LiveRamp, and I want to personally thank him for his decades of service to the company. Bill has brought a strong customer perspective plus a wealth of executive experience to LiveRamp. He was instrumental in transforming the company into a category-creating software business. Both the board and the leadership team are deeply appreciative of Bill\u2019s long service to LiveRamp,\" said Scott Howe.\n\nFinancial Outlook\n\nGiven uncertainties related to the rapidly changing global economic environment, LiveRamp is providing first quarter guidance only.\n\nLiveRamp\u2019s non-GAAP guidance excludes the impact of non-cash stock compensation, purchased intangible asset amortization, and restructuring and related charges.\n\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2021, LiveRamp expects to report:\n\nRevenue of approximately $88 million, an increase of approximately 7% year-over-year.\n\nGAAP operating loss from continuing operations of up to $47 million.\n\nNon-GAAP operating loss of up to $12 million.\n\nConference Call\n\nLiveRamp will hold a conference call at 1:30 p.m. PT today to further discuss this information.

(NYSE:RAMP), then you might want to consider its beta (a measure of share price volatility) in order to understand how the stock could impact your portfolio. Volatility is considered to be a measure of risk in modern finance theory. Investors may think of volatility as falling into two main categories. The first category is company specific volatility. This can be dealt with by limiting your exposure to any particular stock. The second type is the broader market volatility, which you cannot diversify away, since it arises from macroeconomic factors which directly affects all the stocks on the market.\n\nSome stocks see their prices move in concert with the market. Others tend towards stronger, gentler or unrelated price movements. Some investors use beta as a measure of how much a certain stock is impacted by market risk (volatility). While we should keep in mind that Warren Buffett has cautioned that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk', beta is still a useful factor to consider. To make good use of it you must first know that the beta of the overall market is one. Any stock with a beta of greater than one is considered more volatile than the market, while those with a beta below one are either less volatile or poorly correlated with the market.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for LiveRamp Holdings\n\nWhat we can learn from RAMP's beta value\n\nZooming in on LiveRamp Holdings, we see it has a five year beta of 1.27. This is above 1, so historically its share price has been influenced by the broader volatility of the stock market. If this beta value holds true in the future, LiveRamp Holdings shares are likely to rise more than the market when the market is going up, but fall faster when the market is going down. Many would argue that beta is useful in position sizing, but fundamental metrics such as revenue and earnings are more important overall. You can see LiveRamp Holdings's revenue and earnings in the image below.\n\nNYSE:RAMP Income Statement May 21st 2020 More\n\nCould RAMP's size cause it to be more volatile?\n\nWith a market capitalisation of US$2.5b, LiveRamp Holdings is a pretty big company, even by global standards. It is quite likely well known to very many investors. It takes a lot of money to influence the share price of large companies like this one. That makes it interesting to note that its share price has a history of sensitivity to market volatility. There might be some aspect of the business that means profits are leveraged to the economic cycle.\n\nWhat this means for you:\n\nSince LiveRamp Holdings tends to move up when the market is going up, and down when it's going down, potential investors may wish to reflect on the overall market, when considering the stock. In order to fully understand whether RAMP is a good investment for you, we also need to consider important company-specific fundamentals such as LiveRamp Holdings\u2019s financial health and performance track record.

Mr. Huang, please go ahead.\n\nColin Zheng Huang -- Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Nick. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2020 results announcement. It is hard to believe that we're nearly halfway through the year, while COVID-19 has put a much of the world on a holding pattern since February, it has also resulted in a period of intense activity for many industries and the companies seeking to cope with such a unprecedented phenomenon.\n\nCOVID-19 has unleashed a powerful forces that are changing the way we live, work and play. It has compressed the years of the behavioral change and accelerated the adoption of online commerce at an unprecedented pace. Now, more than ever, people are relying on online platforms to meet not just their discretionary one, but for their critical need.\n\nFor a while e-commerce has crossed an important threshold and have become more integral to people's lives. This change also requires a lot of trust on the part of consumers, something that platforms must continue to work hard to earn. As a company, we made a deliberate decision to step up our support of our users and merchant community to help tide them over these challenging times.\n\nIn the near-term these initiatives might have been higher bandwidth costs, more cost to help offset the price increases for medical and household essentials or even more free traffic support for our mostly trusted merchants. But we make these decisions deliberately, because they are consistent with our corporate culture of the firm or doing the right things. These consciousness -- our conscious investments have built-in valuable trust with our users. People remember when you are there for them in their time of need.\n\nThe pandemic also unleashed another powerful force that after need for better ways to interact and socialize online. This need for the right digital tools has never been more important with the fusing of the physical and the virtual worlds, because people must now find the ways to do online what they used to do offline, whether it is going to office, shopping arm in arm at a retail mall, sharing popcorn at movies or having hard parts together. We have positioned ourselves to ride the convergence of these powerful forces. We design our platform to maximize social interaction by tapping our innate desire to connect and share.\n\nOur mission has never been more relevant or salient in these challenging times, which is to provide a fun and engaging environment for people to shop together and get the best value for their money. We know we are on the right track, because we crossed 600 million annual active users -- annual active buyers for the first time this past quarter. And our user engagement metrics continue to improve.\n\nOn how COVID-19 has changed the retail industry. So how has COVID-19 changed the retail industry and the e-commerce. What do these change mean for the company like Pinduoduo? Let me highlight three specific change; first, live streaming. With COVID-19, we realized that the boundaries between virtual and the physical worlds have blurred to an unprecedented degree. We launched our live streaming service in November last year and we have found it to be an effective tool in lowering the barriers to helping consumers overcome their aversion to buying certain product categories online. These categories include high-end jewelries such as pearls and jade, premium seafood like Argentine shrimp or live lobster or even farming equipments.\n\nWe see live streaming not only as a channel to sell products, but more importantly a value for merchants to share their personal experiences and interact with the users. Live streaming is a great way to showcase certain offline experience that otherwise unavailable to many of our users. For example, we organized the live streaming toward to seven major museums worldwide, while featuring select items from their representative gift shops. Through the live streaming, producers build trust with potential consumers by showcasing their work for how they pick food from their farms to how they pack the catch of the day or even how they make delicious meatballs by hand.\n\nLive streaming opens a window into the lives of producers and unfolds the story of the product in a way that a simple listing cannot. Live streaming also helps consumers to better appreciate and differentiate the products by having the merchant demonstrate the product and answering questions just like if one were shopping in the mall.\n\nThe second change is faster online-offline integration. We still see significant opportunity in combining the scale of our online traffic with offline retail experiences. In early May, we joined the forces with Shanghai government and the local enterprises to successfully organize the May 5 shopping festival. In five days we have to drive over RMB3.2 billion of online sales in the Shanghai area through 100 shopping malls, more than 78 million users enjoy the live streaming content produced by 1,136 PDD live streaming rooms in collaboration with CCTV. Users were able to enjoy consumer services for in-store salespeople.\n\nPinduoduo also sold over 600 cars in the first two hours of the festival in a partnership with Shanghai based SAIC Group. We partnered with Guomei to expedite the integration of the online and offline sales experience, home appliances and the consumer electronics product categories where delivery installation and after-sales services are important part of the purchase consideration. Guomei's nationwide retail network would play a crucial role in a part of the sales process and we're working together to redesign the shopping experience.\n\nThe third change relates to helping exporters pivot to the domestic consumer market. Due to the worldwide spread of the Coronavirus, China's export was down 11.4% in the first quarter of 2020, and outlook remains uncertain. We have been working closely with local governments in China to direct export-oriented production capacity toward domestic consumption demand. COVID-19 has forced these high-quality manufacturers to focus on domestic market opportunities earlier than they might have otherwise. This plays well into our C2M vision, and we look forward to working with them to offer more value for money products tailored for our users.\n\nOn COVID-19 impact. In the first quarter of 2020, China's GDP fell by 6.8 from a year ago. Total retail sales of consumer goods were down 19%. At the same time, the worldwide pandemic started to weigh on China's exports. Consumers relied on e-commerce for the bulk of their purchases during the crisis.\n\nSince our March end earnings call, travel restrictions for most areas of China have been lifted and the physical outlets have been reopened. The domestic economy has started to recover, we observed that the online retail sales of physical goods increased by 5.9% during the first quarter, the pace of our online buying picked up in March, when logistics networks and the supply chain resumed to full capacity.\n\nFor Pinduoduo, this past quarter was among the most challenging in our brief history, but we continue to solidly execute our user-centric strategy. For the last 12 months ended March 31st, 2020, we recorded GMV growth of 108% to RMB1,157 billion and served 628 million annual active buyers, up 62% from a year ago and 43 million from last quarter. Our first quarter revenue grow 44% to RMB6.5 billion and it will continue to invest in sales and marketing to engage and support our users when they were mostly in need. This past quarter was also one of the most rewarding for us, because we were able to make significant contributions to the society. We also saw the next generation of leaders emerging as they stepped up to serve our users, which I will explain on later.\n\nDuring the peakest outbreak in China, our team tried [Phonetic] to ensure that the daily needs of our users are matching the timely fashion within the safety of of -- of their homes. We then devoted our energies to support the recovery and online migration of many offline business as the impact of COVID-19 subsidize. As a platform serving over 600 million users, COVID-19 reminded us of how important PDD has become to our ecosystem of users, merchants and the business partners.\n\nIn order to help the small and medium sizesd the business owners and our platform, we proactively reduced advertising fees charged to merchants, provided incentives for those fulfilling orders during outbreak and directed free traffic to medical supplies and and household items that our users needed the most while under quarantine.\n\nIn addition, we subsidized medical products such as mask and disinfectant to help counter price spikes, due to the supply demand imbalance. We also defrayed part of the logistics costs. These initiatives resulted in a lower revenue as a percentage of our GMV and a higher cost of goods sold during the first quarter, but it was the right thing to do I believe.\n\nDuring this time period, we remain focused on building trust with our users, trust in the sense of community has become more critical in such uncertain times. For example, we stepped up our commitment in live streaming and made it accessible to all our merchants, another feature we build trust as a community squad shopping feature that we introduced to help lockdown consumers in local communities to buy daily necessities and fruit from nearby groceries and supermarkets.\n\nAs a result, we have observed a positive impact in our user engagement metrics, although the first quarter is typically the slowest for e-commerce, MAU to active annual buyers ratio increased from 65.4% in the first quarter of 2019 to 77.6% in the first quarter in 2020. This ratio reflects improvement in our user satisfaction and as more users are finding products on our platform of their interest, meet their expectations and a prompt them to place orders.\n\nOn our team and internal initiatives, this past quarter, we overcame some of the greatest challenges since our company's inception. As the founder and CEO, I was touched to see our team put serving our 600 million plus user community as their top priority. This commitment reflects the value of our employees, the corporate culture of [Indecipherable] that we seek to build.\n\nAs I said on our March conference call, we saw many young people emerge through this time period as new leaders of our business. They have stepped up, and they -- and their aspiration and innovation are pushing us all forward in our quest to realize Pinduoduo's vision. During COVID-19, these young leaders made practical business decisions and executed them soundly, exceeding the expectations of our substantial user base. This is why, we as a company were able to accelerate the recovery of our business and grow our average daily order volume to over 50 million in March. They are ready to take on more responsibilities for running the business.\n\nThe year had a -- is very important for PDD. Last year, our GMV crossed RMB1 trillion milestone and has kept growing. We're encouraged by this recognition from our users, but at the same time we feel even greater responsibility of our shareholders. We take this responsibility seriously and we continue to reflect on how we can improve, how can we provide our user with a better experience on PDD. How can we make the discovery on our platform more efficient, more engaging and more fun; how can we offer them more choices and give them more reassurance on quality and value.\n\nThis year we will focus on not only growth, but also on the number of key initiatives that would form a sound foundation for our future. These include continuing to improve on corporate governance, upgrading internal systems, improving personnel development and evaluation, streamline internal approval process and motivating more internal idea generation and resource competition.\n\nIn the past two months, we completed our internal performance review and feedback. As mentioned in our March call, most of our employees received a pay raise in recognition of their dedication and contribution. We have also promoted a number of them. We hope to see more of them grow into new leaders of our company. As I mentioned in my letter to shareholders, in this new era, we as a new life form should proceed more humbly and bear more responsibility. This is true for us as a company and for our young people as a new generation of leaders.\n\nLet me now turn over to David to discuss the financial results for the quarter.\n\nDavid Liu -- Vice President of Strategy\n\nThank you, Colin, and hello, everyone. Let me first comment on our capital markets activity since the end of the first quarter. First, we subscribed for $200 million of convertible bonds in GOME, a leading retailer home appliances and consumer electronics in China. We entered into a strategic co-operation agreement pursuant to which GOME will migrate all the topline SKUs on to our platform and work together with us to offer more customized branded goods and better offline services. We'll continue to evaluate opportunities that will increase value to our users and to our shareholders.\n\nSecondly, we launched a private placement of $1.1 billion at the end of March after receiving strong reverse inquiries on long-term investors. The placement was closed in early April. Net proceeds from the placement will only be reflected in our financials for the June quarter. For the avoidance of doubt, our balance sheet and cash flow statements for the quarter ended March 31st, 2020 do not include cash raised on this placement. Since the placement the company has received a number of questions on our capital raises, operating cash flow and cash position.\n\nLet me take this opportunity to respond. First, why did we go ahead with the private placement in March? Like any blue chip companies such as Berkshire Hathaway, Disney, Pfizer and Netflix that raised capital in the past few months. We also expect high global economic uncertainty and capital market volatility to persist, as the world economy struggles to regain its foothold. At the same time, we expect the challenging outlook to give raise to more attractive investment opportunities. The March private replacement further strengthens our net cash position to weather a potential economic downturn and to pursue strategic opportunities without having to compromise the flexibility in our core business. GOME is a good example.\n\nSecond question, why have we tapped the capital markets so many times since our IPO? This is a good question. In fact, we had anticipated this possibility at the time of our IPO. As Colin mentioned in his shareholders letter this year, we should be and we are extremely grateful of our precious youth. One feature of being young, however is that we grow very fast. This works sometimes to our advantage, but sometimes to our disadvantage.\n\nWhen we went public in 2018, in order to complete our listing expeditiously and not distract management from growing the business, we specifically limited the size of our offering in terms of dilution to be the smallest among comparable US listed TMT companies by market cap. Dilution at the time of our IPO was 8.2%, as compared to anywhere between 10% to 20% stake offered by other issuers at IPO.\n\nAs a result, we were able to complete our IPO on extremely tight timetable as opposed to at least a year for others. We have sold in aggregate 16.2% of our company on a fully diluted and as converted basis, inclusive of IPO, similar to the normal IPO dilution of other US listed companies. As we operate in a hypercompetitive industry against peers with much more substantial capital resources, we believe continuing to be nimble and optimistic on financing will enable us to optimize our net proceeds, while minimizing dilution.\n\nThird question, is PDD raising money again, because it's burning cash too quickly? Many people have assumed that our increased sales and marketing expenses imply we are burning cash and subsidizing our users with investors' capital. We would like to point out to our investors, analysts and the public to look closer at our cash flow statements. Even though we may from time-to-time the core -- quarter of net operating outflow, because of seasonality such as this past quarter. Our cash flows from operations on an annual basis have been positive since 2016.\n\nEven if we exclude changes in payables to merchant, which our funds held in escrow for merchants. Our annual operating cash flows are still positive. This means that the cash generated from our core business is sufficient to fund our operations without using the cash contributed from our financing and investing activities. In addition, our net working capital is negative and changes in our net working operating capital are also negative, reflecting our efficient net working capital management.\n\nIn summary, our operations have been self-sustaining since the end of 2017. We have not needed to spend any proceeds from our capital raising on our operations, including the coupons and promotion programs. Given we already have sufficient cash flow from operations, some investors may want to probe further on why we fund raise from a capital markets at all. This is also a good question.\n\nColin mentioned in his shareholder letter at the time of our IPO that we are committed to become an open and transparent platform from day one, despite being young and far from perfect. As a platform serving 628 million users in China and potentially more in the future. We believe we could provide the public with more transparency, if we are supervised by our users and the market as a public-listed company, just like this quarterly earnings call. It has indeed helped our team to grow faster as a public company in the past two years.\n\nLet me now shift gears and provide some updates on our C2M and agricultural initiatives. Many of our ecosystem partners suffer from COVID-19 and we have been doing our part to help with their recovery. Starting in March, we hosted a series of live streaming PDD fairs in China's key production centers including Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang and Shandong in collaboration with local governments and merchants to promote locally produced specialties.\n\nAs of April 30th, total order number originated from these live streaming events reached 49 million. We have field a strategic cooperation agreements with these local governments to continue our support for high quality local manufacturers and merchants, whom we believe can be strong partners for our C2M initiatives over the long term. Merchants selling agricultural products were also negatively impacted during the outbreak.\n\nIn addition to the measures and support that we mentioned in our March earnings call, we announced our plan to invest RMB50 billion over the next five years to build up infrastructure to assist farmers to sell online more efficiently. Agricultural products contributed 13.6% of our 2019 GMV. In the first quarter of 2020, total orders of agricultural products reached 1 billion, representing 184% year-on-year increase and SKUs were with more than 100,000 orders also reached 1,030 about 70% of our 2019 full-year number. Within the next three years, we'll continue to promote these sales result of agriculture products to traffic support, training, live streaming and other features we aim to have more than 1 million agriculture product stores with more than RMB1 million sales in the year.\n\nNow, let me take you through our financial results for the quarter ended March 31st, 2020, We continue to see strong growth in our key operating metrics in the first quarter of 2020. Our annual active buyers for the last 12 months ended March 31st reached 628.1 million, representing an increase of 42.9 million from our 2019 annual active buyers. Compared to the first quarter in 2019, our last 12-month active annual buyer base grew by 42%. Despite the first quarter being an off-season for e-commerce, our average annual active -- our average monthly active users in the quarter increased from a preceding fourth quarter peak season of 487.4 million or 68% growth from a year ago.\n\nDuring the first quarter, China online gross retail sales grew 5.9% year-on-year to reach nearly RMB1.9 trillion. As most people -- more people stay home, they relied on e-commerce, due to social distancing measures. Pinduoduo saw an increase in purchases of medical supplies and household staples during the peak of the COVID-19 and we observed strong recovery in discretionary consumption in March. Our last 12 month GMV grew 108% year-on-year to reach RMB1.1572 trillion. The strong GMV growth reflected a sustained growth in our annual spending per active buyer, which was 47% to reach RMB1,842.4.\n\nWe recognized that our users are increasingly relying on us. Not only is our active buyer base growing, we see them gaining trusting our platform and buying higher value merchandise at higher frequency. We will continue to serve our users by providing them with a consistent and satisfying shopping experience.\n\nOur total revenues in the quarter ended March 31st, 2020 were RMB6.5 billion, up 44% from RMB4.5 billion in the same quarter last year. Our total revenue comprised of online marketing services revenues and transaction services revenue. Online marketing services revenue contributed RMB5.5 billion this quarter, constituting 84% of our total revenue, this was up 39%, compared to the same period last year.\n\nTransaction services revenue was RMB1 billion this quarter, constituting 16% of our total revenue, and up 76%, compared to the same period last year. This quarter is the first time in our history that our online marketing services revenue increased at a lower rate, compared to our transaction services revenue. This was due to a few different factors: one, as Coronavirus broke during Chinese New Year holiday, small and medium-sized merchants were adversely impacted and hence reduced their advertising spend below their typical low season levels.\n\nTwo, we supported our merchants in particular small and medium-sized enterprises by offering them lower effective advertising rates.\n\nAnd three, we also directed traffic that we could have otherwise monetized to dedicated channels for medical supplies, household staples and other necessities in high demand.\n\nSince March, we have seen pickup in advertising activity by our merchants, including SMEs with advertising rates returning to normal levels. Although the initiatives during the first quarter had a negative financial impact, we believe that we are doing the right thing and fulfilling our responsibility as the second largest e-commerce platform in China. We are building invaluable trust with our 628 million users and 5.1 million merchants in this time of crisis.\n\nMoving on to cost. Our cost of revenues increased 110% from RMB873.3 million in the same period last year to RMB1.8 billion this quarter. This translate to a gross margin of 72%. Total cost of revenue increased mainly due to higher cost for cloud services, call centers and merchant support services, particularly as we rolled out our live streaming features to all the merchants.\n\nTotal operating expenses this quarter were RMB9.1 billion, as compared to RMB5.8 billion in the same quarter 2019. Our sales and marketing expenses this quarter increased 49% to RMB7.3 billion from RMB4.9 billion in the same quarter of 2019.\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, our sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue was 108%, as compared to 103% for the same quarter last year. The increase of our sales and marketing expenses is mainly to help users weather through the pandemic.\n\nGiven the reduced advertising activities by our merchant during the first quarter, particularly in February, we could have pared back our sales and marketing budget for the quarter and focused on minimizing loss. Instead, our management team made a deliberate decision to further invest in our ecosystem and reallocate our spending in ways that would benefit our users and merchants most in this time of crisis, because we consider this the right approach for our long-term success. When COVID-19 started to spread at the end of January, we acted quickly and stabilized prices of medical supplies, and other critical products via targeted subsidies.\n\nIn addition, to assist merchants selling agriculture products to secure their inventories, we provided support and hosted several promotions to boost their sales on our platform. With the economy in China still recovering and the global situation is still evolving, we will continue to invest in building deeper trust and long-term relationship with our users and seller community.\n\n2020 will continue to be an important year of investments for us. Given we have already surpassed 600 million active buyers, we want to reiterate that it is not the new users whom we are investing our sales and marketing on, but all of our users, particularly the existing ones. This is because the existing users come to trust us more. As they come to trust us more, they will share their experiences with their friends and families and their social contacts, and from time-to-time invite them to purchase together.\n\nTherefore, we continue to invest in their trust mindshare [Phonetic] engagement with us. In the next few quarters, we expect our sales and marketing expenses to remain fairly dynamic and we will continue to invest when we see opportunities that meet our ROI requirements.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were RMB338.3 million, an increase of 43% from $236.1 million in the same quarter of 2019, primarily due to an increase in headcount. On a non-GAAP basis, our G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue was 2%.\n\nResearch and development expenses were RMB1.5 billion, an increase of 121% from RMB667.1 million in the same quarter of 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in headcount and the recruitment of more experienced R&D personnel, and an increase in R&D related cloud services expenses. We plan to further invest in our R&D in 2020. On a non-GAAP basis, R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 17%.\n\nTo sum up, operating loss for the quarter was RMB3.6 billion on a non-GAAP basis, compared with operating loss of RMB1.6 billion in the same quarter of 2019. Operating loss on a GAAP basis was RMB4.4 billion, compared to RMB2.1 billion in the same quarter of 2019.\n\nNet loss attributable to our ordinary shareholders was RMB4.1 billion on a GAAP basis, as compared to net loss of RMB1.9 billion in the same quarter of 2019.\n\nBasic and diluted net loss per ADS were RMB3.54 on a GAAP basis, compared to RMB1.64 in the same quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders was RMB3.2 billion, compared to RMB1.4 billion in the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per ADS were RMB2.73, compared to RMB1.2 in the same quarter of 2019. That completes our profit and loss statement for the quarter.\n\nNet cash flow used in operating activities was RMB567.1 million, down from RMB1.5 billion used in the same quarter of 2019, primarily due to an increase in online marketing services revenues. As of March 31st, 2020, the company had RMB32.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. Excluding restricted cash, we had RMB5.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we had RMB37 billion in short-term investments.\n\nOur short-term investments include time deposits, money market funds and other securities that can be monetized readily. As such, investors in evaluating our cash reserve should consider our short-term investment together with our cash and cash equivalents. As of the end of March, we had RMB42.6 billion of cash reserve excluding net proceeds of $1.1 billion from our recent private placement.\n\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready for questions. Thank you.\n\nQuestions and Answers:\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Natalie Wu of CICC. Please ask your question.\n\nNatalie Wu -- CICC -- Analyst\n\nHi, management. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a very robust quarter. So just wondering what do you think that plays as the major driver behind your GMV growth reacceleration in the first quarter, in spite of the COVID-19 impact? And also, in terms of the live streaming function, how does that help your GMV growth on a platform for -- in terms of the SSSG according to your observation? Thank you.\n\nDavid Liu -- Vice President of Strategy\n\nThank you, Natalie, for the question. In terms of GMV growth, we see that as a reflection of our users continued endorsement of our strategy and our platform. And so you have demonstrated through the first quarter we continued to make sales and marketing investments in our users and in our merchants. And as China recover or as the pandemic subsided toward the end of February and heading into March, we have seen strong recovery in consumer demand.\n\nSo overall, I would say that the consumer demand has not been impacted in COVID-19. And you saw a lot of catch-up as a result of both merchants promoting, increasing the promotion activities on our platform, as well as logistics being back in normal levels. So this is why we believe we were able to -- by middle of March start shipping over 50 million daily orders on a daily basis. And because of that, we see that the consumers spending on our platform are now with higher frequency and also with higher ARPU, resulting in overall increase in our LTM GMV.\n\nIn terms of live streaming, specifically, as you have mentioned, this is a new business initiative for us. We only rolled our live streaming to all the merchants in January despite the product being online at the end of last year. We see live streaming as a great way to bring online and offline -- we see live streaming as a great way to bring online, these offline experiences our US users may not be privy to in their daily lives. So through live streamings we are encouraging merchants to bring platform users into their day-to-day to share with them interesting [Indecipherable] parts about their products. As such, we believe that you have the benefit of lowering barrier -- so lowering consumers aversion to spend in certain categories such as jewelry or live seafood that we are selling on the platform. And we believe that this will -- this is beneficial in creating further engagement and stickiness and repeat the purchases between merchants and users.\n\nNick Shu -- Investor Relations\n\nNext question?\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Eddy Wang of Morgan Stanley. Please ask question.\n\nEddy Wang -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nHi, management. Thank you for taking my questions. My question is also about the GMV and the ARPU growth in the first quarter. You mentioned that in March actually you have witnessed your users have increased the discretionary items. Can you elaborate more about what, kind of, the discretionary items you have witnessed user spending in March? And what are the key items categories you would like to expand actually this year for the platform? Thank you.\n\nDavid Liu -- Vice President of Strategy\n\nThank you, Eddy. In terms of our GMV distribution by product categories, I would say that the COVID -19 impact is -- that's temporary. So overall for the quarter we have now observed our GMV distribution to deviate significantly from where it was before. So apparels and FMCG continue to account for the most of our GMV for the quarter. We have seen apparels during the height of the pandemic to be more impacted relative to other categories. But in general, we have seen pickup in activities across the board.\n\nSpecific to our platform, we continue to evaluate our consumers' interest and needs and we continue to expand our strategy of being -- deepening the best offerings in the categories, as far as increasing our breadth. Specifically, I think, you know, as we have demonstrated through much of 2019, our investments in building trust with our users are paying off in categories such as cosmetics, consumer electronics and these will be categories that we continue to grow, heading into 2020, but we are seeing growth across the board.\n\nEddy Wang -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nNick Shu -- Investor Relations\n\nOperator, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Thomas Chong of Jefferies. Please ask your question.\n\nUnidentified Participant\n\nGood evening. Thanks management for taking my questions. I'm asking on behalf of Thomas Chong. And my question is about the GMV strategies. We can see that this time the GMV is showing a very good result and do we have any strategies in driving the GMV and user growth in 2020 and especially in second half? And we also want to ask about any update on the C2M initiative? Thank you.\n\nDavid Liu -- Vice President of Strategy\n\nSure. In terms of our GMV growth driver, as we have mentioned, the focus for the platform or strategy is really revolves around user engagement. And it is about giving the users what they want and serving them well. So we do see the strong growth in the first quarter in our GMV, despite the low seasonality and the challenges posed by the epidemic, as an endorsement by user of our efforts paying off, meaning that we are seeing users being able to shop with more confidence on our platform and buying things with greater assurance and we intend to continue to invest in our user engagements.\n\nAs I mentioned in my own remarks, our social marketing spend are really targeted at all the users on our platform, particularly the existing ones, because these are users who are familiar and recognize the value that we bring to their consumption and these are influences, to put differently, for our platform that will be able to continue to help spread the experiences that PDD to others and help us bringing other users and making them also more engaged on our platform.\n\nIn terms of C2M, I would note that the C2M is a long-term secular trend and it is not a winner-takes-all game. So this is something that will take considerably more time and effort to drive. And in 2019, we have 106 full-fledged C2M partners and we believe we're on track to hit a 1,000 of these partners by year-end of 2020.\n\nThe current -- coming out of COVID-19, as Colin had mentioned, we believe that we are even better -- more better positioned to take benefit, because COVID-19 has forced a lot of export-oriented manufacturers and merchants to rethink a lot harder about their strategy and refocus on the domestic consumption. So by working with the local governance and manufacturers, we have been able to identify a lot of strong potential partners that we believe will accelerate our C2M efforts over the long-term.\n\nUnidentified Participant\n\nThank you so much.\n\nNick Shu -- Investor Relations\n\nNext question?\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Han Joon Kim of Macquarie. Please ask your question. Excuse me, Mr. Han Joon Kim, your line is open.\n\nColin Zheng Huang -- Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer\n\nOperator, why don't we move on to the question?\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Joyce Ju of Bank of America. Please ask your question.\n\nJoyce Ju -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nGood evening, management. Congratulations on a solid result and thanks for taking my question. My question is actually related to the commission revenues we report this quarter. We actually understand this quarter, the advertising revenue actually grow slower than commission revenue, the course of like we actually provide them free traffic through the merchants and also they actually have lower advertising budgets.\n\nBut just curious like per the calculation, like the transaction revenue, it seems like the commission rate this quarter actually is higher than the second half of last year. So just to make sure, do we actually include some of the other like membership revenue or like -- or other transaction related revenue to this revenue line or it's just the core, because we have higher payment or other transaction-related costs. So we have to also increase the charge on the merchants for this particular revenue as well? Thanks.\n\nDavid Liu -- Vice President of Strategy\n\nJoyce, thanks a lot for the question. So to answer your question, our definition for transaction services revenue is consistent through quarters. So it is the same as what we have -- is on the same basis that we have disclosed in the prior quarter. I would say that we do see increased costs in our business and this is partly reflected in the gross margins, because we are investing a lot more aggressively in cloud infrastructures in order to support live streaming on our platform.\n\nJoyce Ju -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nBut on the commission rate side, we are not really adding charts [Phonetic] for payment or as a charge to merchants right?\n\nDavid Liu -- Vice President of Strategy\n\nNo.\n\nJoyce Ju -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nGot it. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Alicia Yap of Citigroup. Please ask your question.\n\nAlicia Yap -- Citigroup -- Analyst\n\nHi. Good evening, management. Thank you for taking my questions. I have a question on the level of the support that you provide to merchants. So any qualitative color that you could give us in terms of the magnitude in which way and for how long? is that in the form of more the free traffic support or is it more the payment commission rebates? And then on the matching, or is it the matching for the promotion pricing now to the sales and marketing? Thank you.\n\nDavid Liu -- Vice President of Strategy\n\nThank you, Alicia. As we -- as I have mentioned in my remark, we do believe that, well, I think, well, a couple of things, I suppose. First, the COVID-19 does mean that our many of our merchants have to cut back their sales and marketing, their own advertising budget in the first quarter and certainly in much of the February this was impacted.\n\nIn response to the difficulties that our merchants are making, we do -- we are offering better incentive programs. This takes both in the form of effectively lower rates, as well as free traffic as you have mentioned. So in terms of trying to exterminate the impact, I will encourage, Alicia, you to take a look at our take rate so to speak for online advertising revenue in other quarters, and estimate how we have the -- I guess, the GMV that we were generating for this quarter, if we were receiving the same type of take rate what that content would be. And I think you will notice that our profitability will be significantly improved.\n\nAnd you're right, in fact, because of the support that we have given to the merchants, I would just add on top of that, we have seen the activities on advertising pickup in March, as well as through the rates returning to more normalized level.\n\nAlicia Yap -- Citigroup -- Analyst\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you. Congrats on the solid results.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Charlie Chen of China Renaissance. Please ask your question.\n\nCharlie Chen -- China Renaissance Securities -- Analyst\n\nHi, management. Thanks for taking my question. So I have a follow-up question on the take rate, which I have elaborated a little bit more. So just to go back to the question, so you are thinking basically the GMV growth basically is robust and you give free traffic as centric to subsidize merchants during this difficult situation. So do you think there is a need for you to continue to subsidize them in this recovery periods in the coming quarter and going forward? And if you don't need to give so much subsidies as you did before, do you think that will be negatively impact your GMV going forward? Thank you.\n\nDavid Liu -- Vice President of Strategy\n\nSo, as I have mentioned earlier, our take rate so to speak or the revenue that we are generating from our online marketing services since March, we have seen that returning to very much normalized level and heading into April and May. We -- and secondly, as I mentioned that by middle of March we were shipping already 50 million parcels on a daily basis. So both the business momentum, I would say for our platform has recovered to fairly normalized level, and also in terms of revenue generation, we believe, we are very close to -- if not ahead of where we were ahead of COVID-19.\n\nCharlie Chen -- China Renaissance Securities -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nNick Shu -- Investor Relations\n\nOperator, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYes. Your next question comes from the line of Piyush Mubayi of Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question.\n\nPiyush Mubayi -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\n\nThank you for taking my call. My question is quite simple in that. If you look at what's happened in the quarter with COVID-19, yet your GMV grew astonishing 99%. I wonder, if you could comment on what the -- what could have happened to your GMV had COVID-19 not happened? And can we use that as a run rate for what could happen for the rest of the year, i.e., are we into an accelerated mode of GMV growth post COVID-19? Thank you.\n\nDavid Liu -- Vice President of Strategy\n\nThanks, Piyush, for the question. I do believe the investment that we have made in our ecosystem, our partners and our users through this period is positive to our overall business momentum and emerging from the COVID-19 and let's just say take early March as a starting point, we do see a stronger business momentum in terms of -- both in terms of user behavior, but also more importantly merchants trying to catch up for a -- the lot of the time that they have lost in the first quarter. So we are certainly seeing more willingness of merchants to spend and engage with users. And that should help to some extent the consumptions. But more importantly, from our perspective, we do think that the users on our platform are now shopping with higher frequency and are making purchases of higher ARPU number -- items.\n\nColin Zheng Huang -- Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes, let me add a few words. So for the first quarter, the pandemic definitely has a negative impact on the business even for the GMV, because the deliver capacity during that period of time is shrink [Phonetic] significantly. Then in China now, all the businesses, sort of, reopened, the society is getting back to normal. So I would say that -- well the growth rate and everything should -- is sort of back to the normal stage. But how big the impact either negative or positive, the pandemic will have on our business. In the short-term, I would say it won't be that significant, let's look at next quarter or the quarter after next.\n\nBut if you look at this problem, I'm trying to answer this problem in a two-year or three-year time frame, I would say it will be very interesting and I would say the impact will be huge either negative or positive, because I believe some of the user behaviors both online and offline will be changed significantly. And many parts of the supply chain is being shaped and/or being shaped or changed in a very fundamental way. And it will not be back to the date -- to the normal stage. It will be a new normal. Whether the new normal is a good or bad, it's hard to say, but it's going to be a new format, it's a new ecosystem. Right now, I think we're, sort of, in a fairly good position to prosper in the next page. Yes, thank you.\n\nPiyush Mubayi -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nNick Shu -- Investor Relations\n\nOperator, let's move to next -- at this time we have -- the next question will be the last question for this call.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Binnie Wong of HSBC. Please ask your question.\n\nBinnie Wong -- HSBC -- Analyst\n\nHi. Thank you, management, for taking the question, and congrats again for a very solid quarter here. I have a question here is that if I look at the -- like the number this quarter in terms of the revenue versus GMV, the quarterly monetization rate boosted a fit to fit. Just a function because of our fast growing GMV or is it because of something else that we are -- because it's the pandemic quarter, we want to support our merchants better? Or is there something else that we should be aware off?\n\nAnd then following up on this question, I think, you spoke about it last quarter, talking about if you look at the mix in terms of how we lift up the ARPU, right? Because, of course, user base were catching up with our peers, but then ARPU is still of a gap, right? How are we going to raise our ARPU this year? Thank you so much.\n\nDavid Liu -- Vice President of Strategy\n\nThank you, Binnie. So, I think your first question was regarding the take rate in general. So during the first quarter, we have seen merchants ability to advertise being impacted by COVID-19, so that's one aspect of it. And because of it and in order to continue support them, we also gave them better effective rates, advertising rates for the first quarter. So that had a direct impact on our online marketing services take rate for the first quarter. I mean, as I mentioned, we have seen the activities pick-up in March and the rates are returning to normal level.\n\nSecond question around the mix and how do we go about increasing the ARPU? I think, the key for us is actually to continue to invest in our existing users to make sure that they continue find products that they find interesting and gain growing confidence to be able to shop more frequently and make this really the primary e-commerce destination. So it's about investing in people's mindshare, it's about investing in the engagement and we have seen result in the pickup in the activities and also in ARPU in the first quarter. And we believe that we are on the right trend. So as the frequency increases and as we bring more selection available to our users, we believe the ARPUs will naturally catch up.\n\nColin Zheng Huang -- Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes. So let me -- regarding ARPU, let me simply put this way. Raising ARPU is not a part of our management team's KPI. But I think it will be a natural result as users engagement increases over time.\n\nBinnie Wong -- HSBC -- Analyst\n\nOkay. Thank you. That's very clear.\n\nColin Zheng Huang -- Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes.\n\nBinnie Wong -- HSBC -- Analyst\n\nThank you so much and congrats.\n\nDavid Liu -- Vice President of Strategy\n\nThanks.\n\nColin Zheng Huang -- Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nI would now like to hand the conference back to Mr. Nick Shu for the closing remarks.\n\nNick Shu -- Investor Relations\n\nOkay.

But the tepid outlook demonstrates the world\u2019s second-largest economy has yet to fully shake off Covid-19, with consumers still hesitant about spending on big-ticket items. Asia\u2019s most valuable corporation is tackling also the rise of rivals such as ByteDance Ltd. and Pinduoduo Inc. And the Tmall operator is going head-to-head with Tencent Holdings Ltd. for internet leadership in everything from online media to payments and cloud computing. JD.com Inc., the No. 2 Chinese online retailer, forecast better-than-expected revenue this quarter.\n\n\u201cThe market is a bit disappointed despite the strength given 2Q guidance of 20-30% YoY growth for JD and 99% GMV growth in 1Q20 for PDD,\u201d CICC analyst Natalie Wu wrote. \u201cWe regard Alibaba\u2019s advantage as a market leader as intact and unchanged in the longer run, though it may take several quarters for market sentiment to swing back.\u201d\n\nRead more: Alibaba Sales Growth Plumbs New Lows While Uncertainty Escalates\n\nAlibaba has lost more than $70 billion of market value since the coronavirus first erupted in January, and now has to grapple with not just an uncertain global economic environment but also any potential fallout from U.S.-Chinese financial tensions. On Friday, executives sought to assuage concerns about a U.S. bill that mandates much closer accounting scrutiny of U.S.-listed Chinese companies and may bar them from American bourses.\n\nChief Financial Officer Maggie Wu said Friday Alibaba\u2019s financial statements have been consistently prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP accounting measures and were beyond reproach. \u201cThe integrity of Alibaba\u2019s financial statements speak for itself, we have been an SEC filer since 2014 and hold ourselves to the highest standard,\u201d she told analysts on a conference call. \u201cWe will endeavor to comply with any legislation whose aim is to protect and bring transparency to investors who buy securities on U.S. stock exchanges.\u201d\n\nThe bigger short-term challenge is in reviving growth: Alibaba\u2019s bread-and-butter customer management or marketing business grew just 3% in the March quarter. Much of that stems from weaker consumer sentiment during the coronavirus-stricken quarter, when total Chinese e-commerce rose just 5.9% or at less than a third of 2019\u2019s pace, according to government data. Jefferies analysts led by Thomas Chong wrote that Alibaba\u2019s guidance was in fact a positive when viewed against an array of uncertainties gripping the post-Covid 19 global economic environment.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nUser engagement and transaction volume have rebounded in April and May to precrisis levels, which bodes well for normalized sales growth ahead, especially as merchant-support measures are gradually rolled back.\n\n- Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nRival PDD posted a revenue rise of 44% on Friday, down sharply from 91% in the previous quarter but ahead of expectations. Its sales and marketing expenses jumped 49%. PDD\u2019s shares climbed 15% Friday.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s March-quarter net income was 3.2 billion yuan, down 88% from a year ago when it booked an 18.7 billion yuan one-time gain on investments. In February, Alibaba declared a waiver of some service fees for merchants struggling financially during the outbreak on its main direct-to-consumer Tmall platform. In April, the company rolled out a new 10-billion-yuan subsidy program for Tmall users to buy electronics, encroaching on JD.com\u2019s traditional turf. These initiatives may further compress margins for the June quarter.\n\nStory continues"}, "News 6": {"title": "Baidu Investors Fell Out of Love Years Ago", "keywords": ["baidu", "love", "nasdaq", "chinese", "investors", "company", "fell", "business", "ago", "bloomberg", "opinion", "technology", "li"], "publish_date": "2020-05-24", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baidu-investors-fell-love-years-210003636.html", "summary": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Five years ago, Baidu Inc. founder and Chairman Robin Li sat down with Bloomberg News to explain how foreign investors were getting it wrong.\nAround the time that Li complained foreign investors weren\u2019t getting it, some of his contemporaries decided to move home where they felt Chinese investors had a better understanding and would reward them with higher valuations.\nInvestors in China won\u2019t assign a higher valuation to a returning company unless it has a convincing growth story to tell.\nBaidu was a pioneer when it listed on Nasdaq in 2005, paving the way for dozens of Chinese internet stocks to follow.\nNisha Gopalan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and banking.", "text": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Five years ago, Baidu Inc. founder and Chairman Robin Li sat down with Bloomberg News to explain how foreign investors were getting it wrong.\n\nListed on the Nasdaq a decade earlier, shares of the Chinese search-engine provider had taken a beating over the prior year, and Li\u2019s chief complaint was that Americans just didn\u2019t appreciate the coming changes in its business. The trend in China was toward services like delivery and ride-hailing, as well as bookings for restaurants, beauty salons and doctors. This online-to-offline economy would eclipse search revenue, he predicted.\n\nNow, it seems that Li has lost patience. Baidu is looking into the possibility of delisting its shares from the Nasdaq and moving to an exchange closer to home, Reuters reported Friday, citing three people familiar with the matter. Baidu thinks it\u2019s undervalued, according to the report.\n\nThe backdrop to these discussions is rising hostility to U.S. investments in Chinese assets amid worsening relations between the two countries. The U.S. Senate passed a bill last week that would force companies to delist unless they can prove they\u2019re not under the control of a foreign government.\n\nThat sounds like a good excuse for Baidu to look for the exit. The reality is that investors lost patience with its management years ago. It was inevitable that the company would seek one day to list elsewhere, as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has already done. Baidu\u2019s U.S.-traded stock fell 15% between that September 2015 interview and the end of last year, before the pandemic hit. Over the same period, Alibaba climbed 248%.\n\nLi\u2019s problem is that his company failed to grasp the transformation he was talking up half a decade ago. While Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd. have successfully moved into new areas like payments and physical retail, and upstarts like Meituan Dianping and Pinduoduo Inc. now dominate delivery and social-commerce, Baidu has barely changed.\n\nIts core business still centers on advertising and accounts for 73% of revenue, which climbed just 2% last year. Investments into new realms like artificial intelligence and autonomous driving have yet to bear fruit. Its other major sales contributor, iQiyi Inc., a video-streaming platform that listed separately on Nasdaq in March 2018, continues to lose money.\n\nAround the time that Li complained foreign investors weren\u2019t getting it, some of his contemporaries decided to move home where they felt Chinese investors had a better understanding and would reward them with higher valuations. Internet security company Qihoo 360 Technology Co. was taken private by a consortium that included Citic Group for $9.3 billion in December 2015. It relisted in Shanghai in 2018 via the purchase of elevator maker SJEC Corp., and now trades under the name 360 Security Technology Inc. Chinese investors have soured on 360 Security, pushing the company\u2019s market value down by more than a third since February.\n\nThere\u2019s a warning for Li. Investors in China won\u2019t assign a higher valuation to a returning company unless it has a convincing growth story to tell. Baidu was a pioneer when it listed on Nasdaq in 2005, paving the way for dozens of Chinese internet stocks to follow. Touted as the Google of China, it symbolized the potential of the sector for American investors. Those days are long gone: Baidu has been eclipsed as China\u2019s technology darling by fasting-growing companies such as Alibaba and Tencent.\n\nThe problem for Li isn\u2019t that investors don\u2019t understand his business. It may be that they understand it too well.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nTim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

If true, positions taken at these depressed levels could pay off handsomely in coming quarters.\n\nHowever, there are no guarantees that these companies will survive, because secondary offerings and/or new loans are struggling to match high cash burn rates, raising the threat of bankruptcies in the fourth quarter and beyond. Cruise ship operators are currently targeting the second half of the third quarter for the resumption of operations, but that's equally dangerous because it will take just a single outbreak and quarantine to trigger a fresh wave of cancellations.\n\nThe COVID-19 infection rate is receding as the Northern Hemisphere heads into the warm summer months, but the virus' seasonal impact is becoming clearer by the day, with high odds for a second wave when temperatures drop in September and October. None of these companies have the cash needed to survive into spring 2021 without at least limited revenues, raising doubts about the wisdom of buying these stocks right now.\n\nSector accumulation readings have also shot higher since March, with several components returning to pre-crisis levels, but secondary offerings are responsible for part of the uptick, with new shares filling portfolios. This dilution will undermine potential gains in coming quarters because the higher float and outstanding shares means each individual share is worth less than it was at the same price just a few months ago, making it harder for upticks to mount contested levels.\n\nTradingView.com\n\nCarnival Corporation & Plc (CCL) topped out well before the current crisis, posting an all-time high at $72.70 in February 2018 and entering a decline that carved a lower high in February 2020, just ahead of a near-death spiral dumped the stock to a 17-year low in the single digits.

These can be C-level executives, other higher-ups, members of a board of directors, or even certain shareholders. They are heavily bought in to a company, and their confidence in its future performance spurs them to buy low, confident that the stock will go high. Maybe they're just good company people, loyal to the brand. Maybe they are experts in their industry and are skilled in making lemonade from lemons.\n\nNow, there's two types of insider trading, and only one of them -- the kind where you trade based on knowledge the general public doesn't have -- will land you in prison. This is not that kind. Instead, call it it substantiated optimism.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires these people disclose their activity within 48 hours (\"before the end of the second business day\") if they own 10% or more of a company's outstanding stock. SEC Form 4, the Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership must be filed, detailing the transaction and their relationship to the company.\n\nOn April 6, Randall J. Weisenburger, Carnival Corporation Board Director since 2009, placed an order for 1.25 million of the company's stock, at $8 a share. That's an insider buy of $10 million. Good for him, but why should we care? As legendary American investor Peter Lynch, who once shepherded the Magellan Fund at Fidelity to $14 billion in assets once said, \"Insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise.\" https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000112760220013347/xslF345X03/form4.xml\n\nOn March 2, CCL traded at $33.06. By the time the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus a pandemic March 11, the stock had dropped to $21.75. Weisenburger waited in the weeds before pouncing, and that strategy has seemed to pay off. By May 19 it was up to $14.14, continuing an uptick that began April 3. Great timing, right? Shares still fall short of the all-time high of $71.61 on Jan. 1, 2018, but analysts are now projecting a bullish short- (two to six weeks) and medium-term (six weeks to nine months) future for the line.\n\nIn fact, CCL stock has increased roughly 83% since Weisenberger's purchase.\n\nWeisenberger increased his personal stake by 997% with the buy \u2014 the first insider purchase of CCL since COVID-19 sent stormy seas to the cruise lines in March. His Form 4 shows he now owns more than 1.375 million shares in the company. Weisenberger's previous CCL insider purchase was on July 3, 2019, when dropped $930,000 to buy 20,000 shares at $46.50 each, bringing him up to a stake of 122,934 shares.\n\nInvestors of Arabia\n\nWith all of its 100 ships docked and no plans to resume operations until August, the world's largest cruise line's stock has dropped in value about 70% overall since the pandemic began. Carnival says it costs about $1 billion \u2014 a month \u2014 to operate the company, and that's why it sold almost 72 million shares of its common stock April 6 at the bargain-basement $8 Weisenburger got in on.\n\nThat also opened the door for other wealthy investors \u2014 namely the Saudi royal family \u2014 whose accounts are managed by the country's Public Investment Fund (PIF). The PIF describes itself as a kind of global angel investor on its website. \"[Our vision is] to be a global investment powerhouse and the worl\u200bd's most impactful investor, enabling the creation of new sectors and opportunities that will shape the future global economy, while driving the economic transformation of Saudi Arabia,\" the mission statement reads.\n\nThe PIF bought 43.5 million shares for about $348 million in cash. The Kingdom (by way of the PIF) now owns an 8.2% stake in Carnival.\n\nSo what motivated Weisenburger and the Saudis to up their antes?\n\nLiquidity is especially important on the sea\n\nOn May 14, Carnival outlined measures it has taken to keep itself afloat during its \"extreme pause in guest operations.\" Carnival Corporation CEO Arnold Donald said recent financial actions like emergency financing and the stock sale, had netted the line $6.4 billion of additional liquidity. He said he is confident of a turnaround.\n\n\"It's also encouraging to note that the majority of guests affected by our schedule changes want to sail with us at a later date, with fewer than 38 percent requesting refunds to date,\" Donald said in a statement to investors online. \"Our booking trends for the first half of 2021, which remain within historical ranges, demonstrate the resilience of our brands and the strength of our loyal recurring customer base, of which 66% are repeat cruisers. In addition, we plan to stagger fleet reentry to optimize demand and operating performance over time.\"\n\nIn short, Weisenburger and the Saudis seem to share the company's optimism about a future recovery.\n\nRed skies at night?\n\nThe mariner's ancient rhyme (not to be confused with the Rime of the Ancient Mariner), \"Red skies at night, sailor's delight; red skies at morning, sailors take warning\" can be applied to Carnival's situation. Basically, tonight's \"red skies\" mean a storm has begun to clear out, and a brighter day with smoother sailing is on the horizon tomorrow.\n\nWhen big insiders and big governments seize an investment opportunity like this, the rest of us should take notice. Is it corporate braggadocio? Maybe. But at its current low share price, Carnival may still be worth at least a small to medium-sized position.\n\nThis latest sale of Carnival stock has raised a lot of money that the company can use to stay afloat for the near future, help it navigate to the other side of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 whenever and wherever that is \u2014 and sail to calmer, more profitable waters."}, "News 3": {"title": "Air bridges not for now but should not rule out in future -UK interior minister", "keywords": ["uk", "interior", "rule", "air", "future", "minister", "bridges", "patel", "travelwhen", "today", "summer", "solution", "writing"], "publish_date": "2020-05-22", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/air-bridges-not-now-not-163854598.html", "summary": "LONDON, May 22 (Reuters) - Britain should not rule out the idea of so-called air bridges with countries who have low infection rates of COVID-19 in the future, interior minister Priti Patel said on Friday.\nThe British government said it would bring in a 14-day quarantine period for almost all international arrivals from June 8.\nAsked during the government's daily news conference about the prospect of Britons being able to go on a summer holiday abroad this year and whether air bridges could be part of the solution, Patel said: \"The foreign office advice is very clear, nothing but essential travel.\"\n\"When it comes to air bridges ... we should be absolutely open to all ideas, this is not for today but this doesn\u2019t mean we should rule this out in the future,\" she said.\n(Reporting by Estelle Shirbon and Alistair Smout, Writing by Kylie MacLellan)", "text": "LONDON, May 22 (Reuters) - Britain should not rule out the idea of so-called air bridges with countries who have low infection rates of COVID-19 in the future, interior minister Priti Patel said on Friday.\n\nThe British government said it would bring in a 14-day quarantine period for almost all international arrivals from June 8.\n\nAsked during the government's daily news conference about the prospect of Britons being able to go on a summer holiday abroad this year and whether air bridges could be part of the solution, Patel said: \"The foreign office advice is very clear, nothing but essential travel.\"\n\n\"When it comes to air bridges ... we should be absolutely open to all ideas, this is not for today but this doesn\u2019t mean we should rule this out in the future,\" she said.

Therefore, many are reasoning that Carnival and the broader cruise ship industry will make a recovery.\n\nGiving fuel to this narrative is that Carnival announced earlier this month that it plans to resume service on Aug. 1.

Since early April, CCL stock has been steadily creeping higher as positive sentiment trickles in.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOf course, the CDC isn\u2019t happy about Carnival\u2019s intent.

Imagine the sentiment for a non-essential function like going on a cruise?\n\nEconomic Realities Work Against CCL Stock\n\nFor those that think this industry offers untapped recovery potential, I would reconsider the thesis. Unlike other disasters that we\u2019ve faced in this country, this is a crisis that has impacted in some significant way every American. Indeed, much of the world has suffered acutely from the pandemic.\n\nTherefore, I don\u2019t believe in the quick recovery narrative that you would find associated with, for instance, tragic accidents. That airplanes crash or that boats sink is an accepted risk that consumers take, particularly because these incidents are rare.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut now, consumers have tuned into a new risk, that of an infectious disease spreading aboard. Actually, the risk isn\u2019t new but the concept of governments taking extreme quarantining measures is. That\u2019s not something that consumers will easily get over, which clouds the bull case for CCL stock.\n\nBeyond that, I also have concerns whether would-be travelers are able to go cruising.

Shifting consumer preferences along with government-mandated travel restrictions work directly against Carnival and crews\u2019 business model.\n\nCast Adrift\n\nBut the grand re-opening has begun. Restrictions are being removed and people are emerging from their hideaways. A new normal is settling in, and the stock market is pricing in a brighter future. No one yet knows how quickly cruise demand will return, though. And that leaves a cloud of doubt hanging over stocks like CCL stock. It\u2019s likely why it has been drifting rudderless for six weeks now. Sellers feel the 80% slashing off the 52-week highs is sufficient to price in the new economic realities. But, buyers remain tepid, lukewarm in their enthusiasm, and thus not yet willing to jam prices higher to join the rousing recovery seen elsewhere.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the price action.\n\nLooking at the CCL Stock Charts\n\nCCL Stock Chart More\n\nSource: The thinkorswim\u00ae platform from TD Ameritrade\n\nThe gravity of the situation quickly settles in when we look at the weekly time frame. From 2018\u2019s zenith of $72.7 to the March low of $7.80, Carnival sank 89%. No matter how you spin it, it\u2019s a loss of disastrous proportions. And, unlike a broad swath of other stocks that have enjoyed V-shaped rebounds, Carnival\u2019s trajectory has merely shifted from down to sideways. Because of the grim prospects for its business in the near term, its share price has lacked the buoyancy seen in other stocks that are sure to exist in the post-coronavirus world.\n\nIt\u2019s as if buyers are waiting for a signal that it\u2019s safe to wade back into the waters. And the gradual reopening isn\u2019t cutting it. On the business side, maybe it arrives in the form of Carnival or one of the other industry giants confirming demand is ramping back up faster than expected. A better-than-expected earnings report could do the trick. If enough parties are surprised, it could lead to a rapid repricing.\n\nOn the price chart front, we need a breakout, preferably accompanied by high volume to confirm institutions are returning. Thus far, the past two months appear nothing more than a short spurt of sideways consolidation for CCL stock. On the bright side, if we can breach $20, there aren\u2019t any resistance zones until $30. The runway, in other words, is clear.\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve included the daily chart so you can see a more detailed view of the trading range carved out. A small shelf has developed with resistance at $15. A push above that could morph into a rally to $17. That could be good for a short-term trade, but in my mind it\u2019s the eventual break above $20 that would really catch my eye.\n\ncarnival cruises stock chart 2 More"}, "no_of_news": 6, "plot_name": "/content/plots/CUKPF.png"}, "ICPT": {"company_name": "Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "News 1": {"title": "ICPT Stock Dives On Unexpected Delay For NASH Treatment", "keywords": ["fda", "dives", "liver", "oca", "obeticholic", "market", "delay", "treatment", "unexpected", "stock", "data", "icpt", "nash"], "publish_date": "2020-05-22", "url": "https://www.investors.com/news/technology/icpt-stock-dives-unexpected-delay-nash-treatment/?src=A00220&yptr=yahoo", "summary": "An unexpected delay for Intercept Pharmaceuticals' (ICPT) liver-disease treatment led ICPT stock to crumble on Friday.\nChardan analyst Michael Morabito expects a short-term impact on ICPT stock.\nHe has a buy rating on ICPT stock.\nICPT Stock Dives On DelayNonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, is a potentially huge market for Intercept and any drugmaker that can successfully treat it.\nOn the stock market today, ICPT stock tumbled 12.2% to 80.51.", "text": "An unexpected delay for Intercept Pharmaceuticals' (ICPT) liver-disease treatment led ICPT stock to crumble on Friday.\n\nX\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration was tentatively set to discuss the benefits and risks of Intercept's obeticholic acid in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis on June 9.

As businesses continue to move beyond their static office spaces and toward an environment where data can be accessed anywhere by employees, the need for software-, platform-, and infrastructure-as-a-service is only going to grow. That's why the Global X Cloud Computing ETF (NASDAQ:CLOU) should be on your buy list.\n\nAs you might imagine, the Global X Cloud Computing ETF is going to give investors an opportunity to be on the cutting edge of cloud technology innovation, all without having to be an expert on the various layers of cloud services. It currently holds 36 different stocks, only two of which have a weighting of more than 5%. This means you're getting a pretty even keel of opportunity, with everything from established infrastructure plays like Amazon to software-as-a-service kingpin Shopify in the mix.\n\nTo be clear, this isn't a value ETF. You're buying it to take advantage of the aggressive growth in cloud services that'll likely be accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. That means you'll need to put up with a high trailing price-to-earnings ratio, as well as net expense ratio of 0.68%, which isn't exactly low. But the payoff could be immense if cloud computing continues to grow by a hearty double-digit percentage for the foreseeable future.\n\nVanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF\n\nIn the investment world, \"this time it'll be different\" is often a dangerous phrase. But when it comes to precious-metal mining companies, this time it may very well be different, which is why the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSEMKT:GDX) is worth buying.\n\nGenerally speaking, physical gold and gold miners perform their best toward the tail-end of a recession and early on during a recovery. In other words, we're nearing the sweet spot for precious-metal miners. However, gold-mining stocks tend to underperform the broader market when the economy is firing on all cylinders, leaving them as long-term laggards. But this time could be different.\n\nIn my 21 years of investing, I've never seen a more perfect setup for the gold market. Global bond yields remain historically low, providing few avenues for investors to lock in guaranteed gains. Even if conservative investors find a positive-yielding bond, chances are that it won't outpace the inflation rate, thereby leading to real-money losses. Tack on unlimited quantitative easing in the U.S. and ongoing uncertainty tied to COVID-19, and you have a recipe that makes gold the logical store of value for the foreseeable future.\n\nHowever, since physical gold offers no yield, the smartest way to play this rise in value is by purchasing gold miners, or more specifically, the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF. I suspect we're in a scenario where we could see gold prices comfortably advance for the next five years. That would be great for mining companies that are able to leverage an increase in the physical price of gold.\n\nALPS Medical Breakthroughs ETF\n\nAnother ETF that the smartest investors will be buying and holding is the ALPS Medical Breakthroughs ETF (NYSEMKT:SBIO).\n\nWhile there are a number of diversified pharmaceutical and biotech ETFs that investors can buy, this one is unique. It holds around six dozen U.S.-based drug developers that typically range in market cap between $200 million and $5 billion and have at least one experimental drug in phase 2 or phase 3 trials. The ALPS Medical Breakthroughs ETF also screens for sustainability -- drug developers aren't added unless they have enough cash to fund their operations for at least two years.\n\nThe interesting thing here is that most clinical trials are doomed to fail. That's why placing a bet on any one clinical-stage biotech or pharmaceutical company can be risky. But when you own a basket of nearly six dozen under one security, all it takes is a few big wins for the ETF to deliver substantive returns.\n\nFor example, top-15 holding Intercept Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ICPT) has a date set with a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) panel on June 9 regarding Ocaliva as a treatment for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In late-stage trials, Intercept's lead drug met one of two co-primary endpoints -- a statistically significant improvement in fibrosis of at least one stage without NASH worsening -- but also led to high instances of pruritus in patients. With no therapies currently approved to treat NASH, Intercept's Ocaliva has an opportunity to achieve first-mover status in a $35 billion indication.\n\nJust a few key wins is all it would take for the ALPS Medical Breakthroughs ETF to shine."}, "News 5": {"title": "Intercept Provides Regulatory Update", "keywords": ["provides", "nash", "update", "product", "including", "candidates", "oca", "fibrosis", "pbc", "liver", "regulatory", "intercept", "ability"], "publish_date": "2020-05-22", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intercept-provides-regulatory-120010620.html", "summary": "The FDA has indicated that it will reach out to Intercept in the near future with a new proposed AdCom date.\nIntercept now anticipates that the FDA\u2019s review of its NDA will extend beyond the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of June 26, 2020.\nOCA has received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA for the treatment of NASH patients with liver fibrosis.\nIn the United States, NASH is currently the second leading cause for liver transplantation overall, and in females, the leading cause.\nFounded in 2002 in New York, Intercept has operations in the United States, Europe and Canada.", "text": "NEW YORK, May 22, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ICPT), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics to treat progressive non-viral liver diseases, today announced that based on discussions earlier this week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has notified Intercept that its tentatively scheduled June 9, 2020 advisory committee meeting (AdCom) relating to the company\u2019s new drug application (NDA) for obeticholic acid (OCA) for the treatment of liver fibrosis due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has been postponed. The postponement will accommodate the review of additional data requested by the FDA that the company intends to submit within the next week. The FDA has indicated that it will reach out to Intercept in the near future with a new proposed AdCom date.

OCA has received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA for the treatment of NASH patients with liver fibrosis.\n\nAbout Liver Fibrosis due to NASH\n\nNonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a serious progressive liver disease caused by excessive fat accumulation in the liver that induces chronic inflammation, resulting in progressive fibrosis (scarring) that can lead to cirrhosis, eventual liver failure, cancer and death. Advanced fibrosis is associated with a substantially higher risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality in patients with NASH. In the United States, NASH is currently the second leading cause for liver transplantation overall, and in females, the leading cause. NASH is anticipated to become the leading indication for liver transplantation in Europe within the next decade. There are currently no medications approved for the treatment of NASH.\n\nAbout Intercept\n\nIntercept is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics to treat progressive non-viral liver diseases, including primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Founded in 2002 in New York, Intercept has operations in the United States, Europe and Canada.

On the surface, all the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act requires is that foreign-owned companies -- not even Chinese companies in particular, necessarily -- be able to prove that they are neither owned nor controlled by a foreign government, and submit their financials for review by an American audit firm overseen by the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.\n\nProblem is, Chinese law doesn't permit that second requirement to happen, and unless China changes its laws, this new U.S. law, once passed, appears likely to result in the delisting of Chinese stocks like 51job.\n\nNow what\n\nOrdinarily, that wouldn't be an insurmountable problem. A \"delisted\" stock could still at least trade over the counter (OTC) in the U.S. -- albeit with less liquidity and probably at a depressed valuation.

Your resilience, ingenuity, and dedication have enabled us to continue delivering strong operating and financial results despite the global challenging macro environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nMr. Li continued, \u201cDuring the first quarter, our dual-engine growth strategy of combining living streaming with short-form videos continued to produce good results across all of our business segments. Bigo Live, our global live streaming platform, achieved 37.8% year-over-year MAU growth with our continuous global expansion. Driven by the rapid growth of Bigo Live in the developed market, the live streaming revenues of Bigo segment increased 92.4% to RMB1,972.3 million (US$278.5 million) in the first quarter. 6 Also, Likee, our global short-form video platform, grew its MAUs by 121.9% year over year as it accelerated its expansion in developed markets and further strengthened its leading position in the key developing markets. In addition, Hago is entering into a new growth phase to become a vibrant social network platform for young generation with solid progress in monetization. Meanwhile, YY Live further cemented its domestic market leadership in China by launching innovative virtual entertainment events and upgrading its live streaming content. Looking ahead, as the consumption of live streaming and short-form video services becomes increasingly prevalent around the globe, we aim to stay at the forefront of this growth surge as we continue to build technology platforms, connect users, offer more diverse and tailored content, and bring joyful and youthful experiences to people everywhere.\u201d\n\nMr. Bing Jin, Chief Financial Officer of JOYY, further commented, \u201cWe started the year with solid first quarter results despite increasing macroeconomic uncertainties. During the first quarter, we grew our total revenues by 49.6% year over year to RMB7,149.4 million, exceeding the high-end of our previous guidance. For now, the adverse impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic to our operation have been relatively mild, as the demand for online entertainment content and engaging social media networks remained resilient. We are confident that our abundant cash reserves, efficient operations, and prudent investment approach have laid a solid foundation for our next phase of global growth and attractive shareholder returns.\u201d\n\nFirst Quarter 2020 Financial Results\n\nNET REVENUES\n\nNet revenues increased by 49.6% to RMB7,149.4 million (US$1,009.7 million) in the first quarter of 2020 from RMB4,780.6 million in the corresponding period of 2019, primarily driven by an increase in live streaming revenues and the contribution from the consolidation of Bigo.\n\nLive streaming revenues increased by 50.6% to RMB6,756.3 million (US$954.2 million) in the first quarter of 2020 from RMB4,485.0 million in the corresponding period of 2019, primarily attributable to the continued live streaming revenues growth in both Huya segment and Bigo segment.\n\nOther revenues increased by 33.0% to RMB393.2 million (US$55.5 million) in the first quarter of 2020 from RMB295.6 million in the corresponding period of 2019, primarily driven by the increase in advertising revenues from Bigo.\n\nCOST OF REVENUES AND GROSS PROFIT\n\nCost of revenues increased by 56.5% to RMB4,945.8 million (US$698.5 million) in the first quarter of 2020 from RMB3,160.3 million in the corresponding period of 2019. Revenue-sharing fees and content costs increased to RMB3,549.4 million (US$501.3 million) in the first quarter of 2020 from RMB2,524.7 million in the corresponding period of 2019 as a result of the increase in live streaming revenues of the Company. Bandwidth costs increased to RMB528.1 million (US$74.6 million) in the first quarter of 2020 from RMB297.4 million in the corresponding period of 2019, as the overseas user base and time spent continued to expand following the consolidation of Bigo.\n\nStory continues\n\nGross profit increased by 36.0% to RMB2,203.6 million (US$311.2 million) in the first quarter of 2020 from RMB1,620.3 million in the corresponding period of 2019. Gross margin was 30.8% in the first quarter of 2020, compared to 33.9% in the corresponding period of 2019. The gross margin contraction was primarily caused by the fact that Huya and Bigo segments had lower gross margins but contributed significantly greater portions of net revenues in the first quarter of 2020, compared to the corresponding period of 2019.\n\nOPERATING INCOME\n\nOperating expenses were RMB2,049.4 million (US$289.4 million) in the first quarter of 2020, compared to RMB1,215.4 million in the corresponding period of 2019. Among the operating expenses, sales and marketing expenses increased to RMB1,038.8 million (US$146.7 million) in the first quarter of 2020 from RMB 534.2 million in the corresponding period of 2019, primarily due to the Company\u2019s increased efforts in sales and marketing activities in overseas markets and the impact of depreciation and amortization related to the consolidation of Bigo. Research and development expenses increased to RMB722.2 million (US$102.0 million) in the first quarter of 2020 from RMB 404.7 million in the corresponding period of 2019, mostly due to the increase in salaries caused primarily by the consolidation of Bigo.\n\nOperating income was RMB186.4 million (US$26.3 million) in the first quarter of 2020, compared to RMB473.6 million in the corresponding period of 2019. Operating margin was 2.6% in the first quarter of 2020, compared to 9.9% in the corresponding period of 2019, primarily due to the decrease in gross margin, the impact of depreciation and amortization related to the consolidation of Bigo and other overseas expansion initiatives.\n\nNon-GAAP operating income7 was RMB613.2 million (US$86.6 million) in the first quarter of 2020, compared to RMB717.3 million in the corresponding period of 2019. Non-GAAP operating margin8 was 8.6% in the first quarter of 2020, compared to 15.0% in the corresponding period of 2019.\n\nNET INCOME\n\nNet income attributable to controlling interest of JOYY Inc. was RMB386.7 million (US$54.6 million) in the first quarter of 2020, compared to RMB3,120.4 million in the corresponding period of 2019. Net margin was 5.4% in the first quarter of 2020, compared to 65.3% in the corresponding period of 2019. The high net income attributable to controlling interest of JOYY Inc. and high net margin in the first quarter of 2019 were mainly due to the remeasurement gain of the Company\u2019s previously held interests in Bigo amounting to RMB2,669.3 million. The higher effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2020 was primarily due to the profit (loss) structure and the different effective tax rates of YY, Huya and Bigo segments. Particularly, the Company did not receive much benefit from losses incurred by Bigo as a majority of Bigo\u2019s business was subject to a low applicable tax rate in its jurisdiction.\n\nNon-GAAP net income attributable to controlling interest of JOYY Inc. was RMB428.9 million (US$60.6 million) in the first quarter of 2020, compared to RMB653.5 million in the corresponding period of 2019. Non-GAAP net margin9 was 6.0% in the first quarter of 2020, compared to 13.7% in the corresponding period of 2019.\n\nNET INCOME PER ADS\n\nDiluted net income per ADS10 was RMB4.49 (US$0.63) in the first quarter of 2020, compared to RMB44.55 in the corresponding period of 2019. The high diluted net income per ADS in the first quarter of 2019 was mainly due to the remeasurement gain of the Company\u2019s previously held interests in Bigo amounting to RMB2,669.3 million.\n\nNon-GAAP diluted net income per ADS11 was RMB4.80 (US$0.68) in the first quarter of 2020, compared to RMB9.32 in the corresponding period of 2019.\n\nBALANCE SHEET AND CASH FLOWS\n\nAs of March 31, 2020, the Company had cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, short-term deposits, restricted short-term deposits and short-term investments of RMB26,567.1 million (US$3,752.0 million). For the first quarter of 2020, net cash from operating activities was RMB373.7 million (US$52.8 million).\n\nSHARES OUTSTANDING\n\nAs of March 31, 2020, the Company had a total of 1,610.4 million common shares, or the equivalent of 80.5 million ADSs, outstanding.\n\nBusiness Outlook\n\nThis forecast no longer takes the operating results of Huya into account as the Company no longer consolidates the operating results of HUYA Inc. For the second quarter of 2020, the Company expects net revenues to be between RMB5.00 billion and RMB5.15 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of 16.7% to 20.2%, excluding the revenue contribution from Huya in the same period of last year. This forecast considers the potential impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and reflects the Company\u2019s current and preliminary views on the market and operational conditions, which are subject to change, particularly as to the potential impact of the COVID-19 on the economy in China and elsewhere.\n\nRecent Developments\n\nOn April 3, 2020, the Company announced that it had transferred 16,523,819 Class B ordinary shares of HUYA Inc. to Linen Investment Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tencent Holdings Limited (\u201cTencent\u201d) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately US$262.6 million in cash, pursuant to Tencent\u2019s exercise of its option to purchase additional shares of Huya from the Company. The purchase price was determined based on the average closing prices of Huya\u2019s American depositary shares in the last 20 trading days prior to the receipt of Tencent\u2019s written exercise notice by JOYY and Huya in accordance with Huya\u2019s second amended and restated shareholders agreement dated March 8, 2018. As a result of the closing of the share transfer, Tencent increased its voting power in Huya to 50.1% on a fully-diluted basis, or 50.9% calculated based on the total issued and outstanding shares of Huya.

All information provided in this press release and in the attachments is as of the date of this press release, and JOYY does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as required under applicable law.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial information is prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). JOYY uses non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income attributable to controlling interest of JOYY Inc., non-GAAP net margin attributable to controlling interest of JOYY Inc., non-GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders of JOYY Inc., and basic and diluted non-GAAP net income per ADS, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP operating income is operating income excluding share-based compensation expenses, impairment of goodwill and investments, amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions, and gain on disposal of subsidiaries and business. Non-GAAP operating margin is non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of net revenues. Non-GAAP net income is net income excluding share-based compensation expenses, impairment of goodwill and investments, amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions, gain on disposal of subsidiaries and business, gain on disposal of investments, gain (loss) on fair value change of investments, reconciling items on the share of equity method investments, fair value change on derivatives, interest expenses related to the convertible bonds\u2019 amortization to face value, and income tax effects of above non-GAAP reconciling items. Non-GAAP net income attributable to controlling interest of JOYY Inc. is net income attributable to controlling interest of JOYY Inc. excluding share-based compensation expenses, impairment of goodwill and investments, amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions, gain on disposal of subsidiaries and business, gain on disposal of investments, gain (loss) on fair value change of investments, reconciling items on the share of equity method investments, fair value change on derivatives, interest expenses related to the convertible bonds\u2019 amortization to face value, income tax effects of above non-GAAP reconciling items and adjustments for non-GAAP reconciling items for the net (loss) income attributable to non-controlling interest shareholders. Non-GAAP net margin is non-GAAP net income attributable to controlling interest of JOYY Inc. as a percentage of net revenues. Non-GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders of JOYY Inc. is net income attributable to common shareholders of JOYY Inc. excluding share-based compensation expenses, impairment of goodwill and investments, amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions, gain on disposal of subsidiaries and business, gain on disposal of investments, gain (loss) on fair value change of investments, reconciling items on the share of equity method investments, fair value change on derivatives, interest expenses related to the convertible bonds\u2019 amortization to face value, accretion, cumulative dividend and deemed dividend to subsidiaries\u2019 preferred shareholders and income tax effects of above non-GAAP reconciling items and adjustments for non-GAAP reconciling items for the net (loss) income attributable to non-controlling interest shareholders. After the non-GAAP reconciliation, non-GAAP net income attributable to controlling interests of JOYY Inc. is equal to the non-GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders of JOYY Inc. Basic and diluted non-GAAP net income per ADS is non-GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders of JOYY Inc. divided by weighted average number of ADS used in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per ADS. The Company believes that separate analysis and exclusion of the non-cash impact of above reconciling items adds clarity to the constituent parts of its performance. The Company reviews these non-GAAP financial measures together with GAAP financial measures to obtain a better understanding of its operating performance. It uses the non-GAAP financial measure for planning, forecasting and measuring results against the forecast. The Company believes that non-GAAP financial measure is useful supplemental information for investors and analysts to assess its operating performance without the non-cash effect of (i) share-based compensation expenses and amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions, fair value change on derivatives, interest expenses related to the convertible bonds\u2019 amortization to face value, which have been and will continue to be significant recurring expenses in its business, (ii) impairment of goodwill and investments, gain on disposal of subsidiaries and business, gain on disposal of investments, gain (loss) on fair value change of investments, reconciling items on the share of equity method investments, and accretion, cumulative dividend and deemed dividend to subsidiaries\u2019 preferred shareholders, which may not be recurring in its business, and (iii) income tax expenses and non-GAAP adjustments for net (loss) income attributable to non-controlling interest shareholders, which are affected by above non-GAAP reconciling items. However, the use of non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations as an analytical tool. One of the limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not include all items that impact the Company\u2019s net income for the period. In addition, because non-GAAP financial measures are not measured in the same manner by all companies, they may not be comparable to other similar titled measures used by other companies. In light of the foregoing limitations, you should not consider non-GAAP financial measure in isolation from or as an alternative to the financial measure prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nThe presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned \u201cJOYY Inc.

These adjustments amounted to RMB42.2 million (US$6.0 million) and reversal of RMB2,466.9 million in the first quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively. Please refer to the section titled \u201cReconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results\u201d for more details.\n\n4 Refers to mobile average monthly active users.

Each ADS represents twenty Class A common shares of the Company. Diluted net income per ADS is net income attributable to common shareholders of JOYY Inc. divided by weighted average number of diluted ADS.\n\n11 Non-GAAP diluted net income per ADS is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is defined as non-GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders of JOYY Inc. divided by weighted average number of ADS used in the calculation of diluted net income per ADS.

This could be related to the recent financial results - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.\n\nSee our latest analysis for JOYY\n\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nWhile the share price declined over five years, JOYY actually managed to increase EPS by an average of 19% per year. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Or possibly, the market was previously very optimistic, so the stock has disappointed, despite improving EPS.\n\nIt is unusual to see such modest share price growth in the face of sustained EPS improvements. We can look to other metrics to try to understand the situation better.\n\nIn contrast to the share price, revenue has actually increased by 34% a year in the five year period. A more detailed examination of the revenue and earnings may or may not explain why the share price languishes; there could be an opportunity.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nNasdaqGS:YY Income Statement May 19th 2020 More\n\nJOYY is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think JOYY will earn in the future (free analyst consensus estimates)\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nJOYY shareholders are down 17% for the year, but the market itself is up 2.0%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 3.8% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - JOYY has 2 warning signs (and 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable) we think you should know about.\n\nBut note: JOYY may not be the best stock to buy.

The number of annual average customers on its China retail marketplaces hit 726 million in the quarter, up 15 million from the 12-month period that ended in December.

ELF, +16.84% beat Wall Street expectations for its fiscal fourth-quarter sales and adjusted profit. A sales increase was mostly thanks to \u201cincreased productivity across our retail and e-commerce channels, partially offset by the closing of all 22 E.L.F. retail stores in February 2019\u201d due to the pandemic. The company has seen \u201csignificant decline in retail sales due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer behavior,\u201d with sales expected to be negatively impacted until consumers return to normal shopping patterns.\u201d E.L.F. suspended fiscal 2021 guidance, and drew $20 million of its $50 million revolving credit facility, giving it about $65 million in cash on hand.\n\n\u2022 Foot Locker reported a wider-than-expected fiscal first-quarter loss as revenue fell and the gross margin rate dropped as the pandemic led to store closures. The company suspended its quarterly dividend--the last dividend paid was 40 cents a share--\u201dto preserve financial flexibility.\u201d. The gross margin rate declined to 23.0% from 33.2%, while the expense rate increased to 26.9% from 20.0%. Merchandise inventory increased 20.4% to $1.46 billion.

Since most of its stores were open for less than seven weeks of the 13-week period, the company did not report same-store sales. The company began reopening some stores last week depending on location, and about 700 stores have reopened since. \u201cWe have a deep bench of proven and experienced leaders throughout the business as well as a very strong financial foundation with over $3.0 billion in liquidity, which in addition to our cash balances includes a new $500 million revolving credit facility,\u201d Chief Executive Barbara Rentler said.\n\n\u2022 Under Armour Inc.

Ford (NYSE:F) has certainly not proved immune, having shut down much of its production during the early days of the spread of the disease, under both government-required closures, and the reality that auto sales were set to plummet as more people lost their jobs.\n\nFast-forward to today, and 27.5 million Americans are unemployed, millions more are dealing with reduced hours, and even more \"gig economy\" workers classified as contractors and not employees are also out of work. That's a lot of people not likely to buy a new car anytime soon.\n\nFord responded quickly to bolster its balance sheet at the outset of the pandemic, borrowing an extra $15 billion and suspending the dividend in late March. With signs that some parts of the economy are opening up (including some of Ford's plants) and strong demand for its most-profitable vehicles, it's looking likely that the company will indeed come through the worst of the crisis and emerge, if not stronger, than strong enough to profit from the eventual economic recovery once we beat COVID-19.\n\nSo let's take a look a little further into the future? What might Ford look like in five years? More importantly, what would that mean for investors who own -- or buy -- Ford shares today?\n\nBuilt to withstand the bad times\n\nNeedless to say, when Ford management made the decision a number of years back to maintain a massive amount of cash on the balance sheet, they weren't foreseeing anything like the coronavirus pandemic. In 2016, Ford's then-CFO said the company wanted its balance sheet to be strong enough to support the dividend through anything but the worst recession.\n\nFord lost $2 billion in the first quarter, and could lose more than $5 billion in the second quarter, but it ended Q1 with $46 billion in cash and equivalents, while the dividend suspension will cut cash spending by $2.4 billion annualized. As a result, the company will have more than sufficient cash to get to the end of 2020 under current conditions.\n\nThe worst may be over -- but it could be bad for a while\n\nEven as demand for other passenger vehicles has remained weak, surging demand for pickups and SUVs is great news for the company. Ford has already restarted some North American factories, hiring additional workers to account for increased absenteeism resulting from enhanced safety practices.\n\nThe company's plants in China have been reopened for weeks now. Now is the time for Ford to transition from almost zero revenue to generating cash flows from these operations. It won't come close to being enough to offset all of its cash burn from fixed expenses like paying interest on its debt, but it's a start toward what will hopefully be a steady increase in sales as things return to some semblance of normal.\n\nWhat will normal look like for Ford?\n\nThe coronavirus lockdown has allowed plenty of companies to realize the potential benefits of remote work, and several big tech companies have already said they plan to allow more employees to work remotely in the future. Not only could this cut expenses for employers, but it could also increase the pool of potential employees to include people who have the skills, but are not interested in relocating.\n\nIt could also prove a boon for workers who could save money by eliminating the daily commute, allowing them the freedom to live virtually anywhere. It could also further juice the prospects for ridesharing and autonomous vehicles; less need for a daily commuter vehicle could mean more people forego car ownership entirely. That's created uncertainty for Ford and other automakers.\n\nThis is where I think a healthy dose of reality is important. The fact is, remote work isn't a new concept; other companies, notably Yahoo! a number of years ago, have given remote work a shot in the past, with mixed results. Sure, the proliferation of new tools will make working from home -- or a neighborhood coffee shop -- easier and more productive. But count me among those who don't expect we will look back at the coronavirus pandemic as being the birthplace of some mass remote work movement. Most people simply aren't wired to work in essentially isolation, and long-term, human nature trumps technology. Not to mention that far fewer jobs are conducive to this kind of work than I expect most people realize.\n\nMy expectation is that where Ford and other automakers will be impacted from technology is via the growth of autonomous driving and more wide-scale car sharing. The implications for individual car ownership are far larger than work-from-home.\n\nFive years ahead, Ford will be a leader\n\nExpectations aside, global transportation is going only grow in the future, and Ford is investing where the demand will be. Between developing rideshare and autonomous platforms, Ford is taking steps to make sure it participates in this part of the future of automobiles. The company is also likely to be a leader in auto electrification and other alternative energy drivetrains as more car buyers look to move away from fossil fuels.\n\nI also expect that management will continue to prioritize a fortress-like balance sheet. It may not have planned for the first global pandemic in over a century, but it will prove the difference in the company emerging on the other side with the financial flexibility to continue investing in the future of automobiles. I also expect that enough time will have passed for the company to have once again started paying a solid dividend that's sustainable through all but the worst economic downturns."}, "News 4": {"title": "GM truck production plans delayed by parts shortage: WSJ", "keywords": ["postponed", "wsj", "michigan", "workers", "plans", "production", "shortage", "truck", "delayed", "according", "parts", "report", "gm"], "publish_date": "2020-05-22", "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gm-truck-production-plans-delayed-by-parts-shortage-wsj-2020-05-22?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo", "summary": "A shortage of parts from Mexico is hampering the General Motors Co.'s plans to increase its production of pickup trucks, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal that cited a union official and other people familiar with the matter.\nGM has postponed plans to add more shifts due to the shortage, according to the report.\nThe auto maker doesn't yet have the flow of parts it needs to accelerate production as planned, and it has postponed plans to call back roughly 1,300 workers to factories in Indiana and Michigan.\nA spokesperson for GM told the newspaper that the company continues to plan \"to ramp up production in a gradual cadence,\" without discussing scheduling specifics.\nEarlier this week, Ford Motor Co.

Its international operating regions including Europe, Australia and New Zealand were not included in the U.S. proceedings.\n\nThe firm, whose largest shareholder is billionaire investor Carl Icahn, is reeling from government orders restricting travel and requiring citizens to remain home. A large portion of Hertz's revenue comes from car rentals at airports, which have all but evaporated as potential customers eschew plane travel.\n\nWith nearly $19 billion of debt and roughly 38,000 employees worldwide as of the end of 2019, Hertz is among the largest companies to be undone by the pandemic. The public health crisis has also caused a cascade of bankruptcies or Chapter 11 preparations among companies dependent on consumer demand, including retailers, restaurants and oil and gas firms.\n\nU.S. airlines have so far avoided similar fates after receiving billions of dollars in government aid, an avenue Hertz has explored without success.\n\nThe Estero, Florida-based company, which operates Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty car-rentals, had been in talks with creditors after skipping significant car-lease payments due in April. Forbearance and waiver agreements on the missed payments were set to expire on May 22. Hertz has about $1 billion of cash.\n\nThe size of Hertz's lease obligations have increased as the value of vehicles declined because of the pandemic. In an attempt to appease creditors holding asset-backed securities that finance its fleet of more than 500,000 vehicles, Hertz has proposed selling more than 30,000 cars a month through the end of the year in an effort to raise around $5 billion, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nOn May 16, the board appointed executive Paul Stone to replace Kathryn Marinello as CEO. Hertz earlier laid off about 10,000 employees and said there was substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nHertz's woes are compounded by the complexity of its balance sheet, which includes more than $14 billion of securitized debt. The proceeds from those securities finance purchases of vehicles that are then leased to Hertz in exchange for monthly payments that have risen as the value of cars fall.\n\nHertz also has traditional credit lines, loans and bonds with conditions that can trigger defaults based on missing those lease payments or failing to meet other conditions, such as delivering a timely operating budget and reimbursing funds it has borrowed.\n\nHertz earlier signaled it could avoid bankruptcy if it received relief from creditors or financial aid the company and its competitors have sought from the U.S. government. The U.S. Treasury has started assisting companies as part of an unprecedented $2.3 trillion relief package passed by Congress and signed into law.\n\nA trade group representing Hertz, the American Car Rental Association, has asked Congress to do more for the industry by expanding coronavirus relief efforts and advancing new legislation targeting tourism-related businesses.\n\nEven before the pandemic, Hertz and its peers were under financial pressure as travelers shifted to ride-hailing services such as Uber.\n\nTo combat Uber, Hertz had adopted a turnaround plan, aiming to modernize its smartphone apps and improve management of its fleet of rental cars.\n\nHertz traces its roots to 1918, when Walter Jacobs, then a pioneer of renting cars, founded a company allowing customers to temporarily drive one of a dozen Ford Motor Co Model Ts, according to the company's website.

Companies are starting to take reservations for August and laying out plans to launch ships in a phased manner. On top of the operational optimism, all three of these companies have raised funds that should allow them to remain solvent for multiple quarters, if not years, without customers. That's the long-term picture, but it's not what's driving shares today.\n\nWhat got investors excited in the short term was Credit Suisse analyst Benjamin Chaiken initiating coverage on the industry with a relatively bullish outlook. He initiated Norwegian Cruise Line with an outperform rating and a $21 price target, Royal Caribbean with an outperform rating and a $67 price target, and Carnival with a $12 price target and a neutral rating. Given the price targets, it's understandable why Chaiken is more bullish on Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean, with their current prices around $14 and $44 per share, respectively.\n\nNow what\n\nThe short-term driver of cruise line shares isn't something I would put much energy into as an investor. Analyst upgrades or downgrades can move stocks in the short term, but long-term business fundamentals and consumer spending are what will drive a recovery in the cruise line business.\n\nWhat investors should be cautious about is the early customers eager to cruise again in late summer or fall being followed by a very skeptical market in 2021. Travel is likely to be down across the globe for the foreseeable future and while there are cruise diehards, it's the marginal customer that's going to drive profitability for the growing fleet of cruise liners in operation. It's this long-term risk that will keep me from investing in cruise line stocks today.

It\u2019s the people who decide with their wallet what they want to do and it\u2019s not clear they\u2019ll return to the open waters.\n\nRecently, the Washington Post noted that 58% of American adults are concerned about going back to work, fearful that they might inadvertently infect their households. Imagine the sentiment for a non-essential function like going on a cruise?\n\nEconomic Realities Work Against CCL Stock\n\nFor those that think this industry offers untapped recovery potential, I would reconsider the thesis. Unlike other disasters that we\u2019ve faced in this country, this is a crisis that has impacted in some significant way every American. Indeed, much of the world has suffered acutely from the pandemic.\n\nTherefore, I don\u2019t believe in the quick recovery narrative that you would find associated with, for instance, tragic accidents. That airplanes crash or that boats sink is an accepted risk that consumers take, particularly because these incidents are rare.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut now, consumers have tuned into a new risk, that of an infectious disease spreading aboard. Actually, the risk isn\u2019t new but the concept of governments taking extreme quarantining measures is. That\u2019s not something that consumers will easily get over, which clouds the bull case for CCL stock.\n\nBeyond that, I also have concerns whether would-be travelers are able to go cruising. Much talk has been made of the latest jobless claims report, where 2.4 million have filed for unemployment benefits. Over a nine-week period, nearly 39 million Americans filed for aid.\n\nInitial vs. continued jobless claims More\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart by Josh Enomoto\n\nSeveral media pundits have pointed out a silver lining in the otherwise stark data. Since jobless claims hit a peak around late March/early April, the number of people making claims has declined significantly. However, I don\u2019t see that as good news.\n\nWhen the crisis first became serious, virtually all non-essential services (i.e. restaurants, sporting events, movie theaters, etc.) shut down. That left millions of service industry workers out of a job, explaining the massive spike in claims."}, "News 3": {"title": "2 Top Cruise Line Stocks to Buy and 1 to Avoid During the Coronavirus Crisis", "keywords": ["crisis", "think", "stocks", "demand", "chaiken", "cruise", "analyst", "line", "caribbean", "industry", "rcl", "avoid", "travel", "coronavirus", "buy", "credit"], "publish_date": "2020-05-22", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-top-cruise-line-stocks-110238376.html", "summary": "It has been anything but smooth sailing for the cruise industry.\nTo survive, cruise operators have gone into cash preservation mode, entering into liquidity enhancing credit agreements.\nHowever, five-star analyst Benjamin Chaiken, of Credit Suisse, has a more optimistic view of the industry.\nThe analyst does remind clients that not all cruise industry players are set to outperform, recommending that investors avoid one in particular.\nThe Credit Suisse analyst argues that part of the company\u2019s strength is derived from the location in which it operates cruises.", "text": "It has been anything but smooth sailing for the cruise industry.

To survive, cruise operators have gone into cash preservation mode, entering into liquidity enhancing credit agreements.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, investors are hardly lining up to pull the trigger on names within this area of the market. However, five-star analyst Benjamin Chaiken, of Credit Suisse, has a more optimistic view of the industry. He acknowledges that \u201cCOVID -19 may be the toughest challenge the industry has ever faced\u201d, with it potentially taking several years to regain pricing parity. That being said, he argues the \u201cunmatched value proposition of the product\u201d will power a rebound, and that the recent weakness presents an attractive entry point with liquidity struggles already built in.\n\nHighlighting the resiliency of the industry, Chaiken said, \"The cruise industry has bounced back before from deadly accidents, sudden regulatory changes and storms.\u201d He added, \u201cAdditionally, we think the cruise demographic is favorable for a recovery in demand, and could be why 55% of cruise customers, according to our checks, are opting for a cruise credit vs. cash, post COVID -19 disruption. We think this is a very powerful data point highlighting the resiliency in the product, and speaks volumes in terms of future demand for the industry, especially in the context of current sentiment which questions if the product will even exist in the future.\u201d\n\nTaking all of this into consideration, Chaiken points to two cruise line stocks with especially strong long-term growth narratives, initiating coverage of each with bullish ratings. The analyst does remind clients that not all cruise industry players are set to outperform, recommending that investors avoid one in particular.\n\nUsing TipRanks\u2019 database, we wanted to see if other Wall Street analysts agree with Chaiken\u2019s calls. Here\u2019s what we found out.\n\nRoyal Caribbean (RCL)\n\nWith 63 ships carrying approximately 6 million passengers every year, Royal Caribbean counts itself as one of the top cruise ship operators. While COVID-19 has certainly taken a toll on the company, Chaiken believes that when demand recovers, RCL will be a major beneficiary.\n\nThe Credit Suisse analyst argues that part of the company\u2019s strength is derived from the location in which it operates cruises. \u201cWe think the Caribbean \u2013where RCL is best positioned in terms of capacity allocation and product--could be a bright spot when demand does return. Many Caribbean itineraries require little or no air travel to embarkation, which we think is likely a positive for those with remaining fear over air travel,\u201d he explained. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that \u201cRCL has the ability to market to guests with a shorter booking window.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Chaiken implores investors to take RCL\u2019s performance before the onset of the public health crisis into account. \"We think RCL was gaining significant momentum heading into the Coronavirus-led slowdown, with its CocoCay destination (a private island in the Bahamas offering differentiated land-based activities), demanding price premiums and an had been planning an 80% increase in volume in 2020 vs. 2019, prior to the outbreak,\u201d the analyst stated. He added, \u201cRCL finished 2019 at 108% occupancy and reported net yields of 8%.\u201d\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, Chaiken expects several potential tailwinds to emerge post-COVID-19. Its acquisition of Silversea added two ships to the fleet and expanded its agent network, providing a tailwind to yields. Cost tailwinds could also be in RCL\u2019s future.\n\nEven though liquidity and cash burn are considered by some to be a cause for concern, Chaiken is optimistic. \u201cRCL recently raised $3.3 billion in secured notes, giving us further confidence that they should be able to manage the slowdown,\u201d he noted.\n\nTo this end, Chaiken kicked off his RCL coverage by publishing an Outperform rating. Accompanying the bullish call is a $67 price target, which suggests 55% upside potential. (To watch Chaiken\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nLooking at the consensus breakdown, the bulls have it. RCL\u2019s Moderate Buy consensus rating breaks down into 8 Buys, 5 Holds and 1 Sell. At $60.36, the average price target implies 39% upside potential.

Reporting from the Washington Post and the Miami Herald shows as many as 65 people may have died after being exposed to the coronavirus onboard cruise ships.\n\nIn late March, the CDC recommended deferring all cruise travel during the pandemic.\n\nEarlier this month, however, cruise operators indicated that by the end of the summer they expect to have ships embarking on cruises and executives from multiple cruise companies have indicated positive booking trends.\n\nAnd analysts at Credit Suisse led by Benjamin Chaiken think now is the time to Buy.\n\nIn a note to clients published Thursday, Chaiken initiated coverage of the three major cruise operators \u2014 Royal Caribbean (RCL), Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH), and Carnival Cruises (CCL) \u2014 putting an Outperform rating on Royal and Norwegian and a Neutral rating on Carnival. Credit Suisse put a $67 price target on Royal shares, a $21 price target on Norwegian stock, and a $12 target on shares of Carnival.\n\nShares of Royal and Norwegian rose more than 8% on Thursday following the news; Carnival shares rose over 3%.

We believe CCL has 9 months of liquidity (good through the end of November), NCLH ~27 months, and RCL ~12+ months.\u201d\n\nIn other words, none of these companies are at imminent risk of running out of cash after the initial phase of this pandemic appeared to pose an existential threat to the business. Surviving the next few months, however, does not make for a great thesis on its own.\n\nFor that, Chaiken digs into what cruises actually offer consumers: affordable vacations.\n\n\u201cWhile COVID-19 will likely have a lasting impact on the cruise industry, which will potentially take years to regain pricing parity, we think the unmatched value proposition of the product will be a driving force behind a recovery,\u201d Chaiken writes.\n\n\u201cA cruise includes accommodations, activities, meals, and often drinks, at a 50-70% discount to many other types of vacations. We are unable to think of a vacation alternative that involves international travel, multiple locations, entertainment (from live shows to shore excursions), and resort-like amenities at this price point. We believe this is a primary reason cruise demand has rebounded after past slowdowns, with demand returning in ~8-10 months per our estimates.\u201d\n\nCredit Suisse's work suggests cruises offer consumers a significant discount to land-based alternatives. (Source: Credit Suisse) More\n\nCredit Suisse\u2019s rough math suggests a Caribbean cruise from New Yotk offers a tropical vacation at about 1/3 the cost of flying to the Bahamas. And, yes, of course these trips aren\u2019t exactly equivalent and a few-hours-long pit stop on an island doesn\u2019t replace the experience of walking a few steps to the beach.\n\nBut a $700 vacation is accessible to a far larger number of consumers than a $2,000-plus vacation. And when consumer concerns about safety are addressed and pandemic fears subside, that value isn\u2019t going to go away, in Credit Suisse\u2019s view."}, "News 5": {"title": "How Getting Aboard Royal Caribbean Stock Makes Sense Following Earnings", "keywords": ["good", "low", "getting", "shares", "makes", "investors", "caribbean", "market", "royal", "rcl", "stock", "earnings", "following", "sense", "aboard", "operations"], "publish_date": "2020-05-22", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/getting-aboard-royal-caribbean-stock-090127026.html", "summary": "Yet shares of distressed Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) have been left to drift in bearish technical waters.\nNow though and following earnings, is it time for investors to finally board RCL stock with an eye on calmer conditions ahead?\nHow Getting Aboard RCL Stock Makes Sense Following Earnings MoreSource: Laszlo Halasi / Shutterstock.comThe novel coronavirus and ensuing Covid-19 pandemic have been challenging to say the least for cruise line operator Royal Caribbean.\nRCL Stock Monthly Stock ChartSource: Charts by TradingViewOn the RCL price chart, investors electing to board the stock as an investment should be prepared for volatility.\nStill, it should be appreciated Royal Caribbean\u2019s low is more than 50% beneath current prices.", "text": "A bullish market tide has been lifting most risk assets of late.

Not that it\u2019s alone. If misery loves company, Carnival (NYSE:CCL) and Norwegian Cruise Lines (NYSE:NCLH) are in the same boat. Still, operations have been remained shuttered since March. What\u2019s more, under RCL\u2019s current no-sail policy, its cruises aren\u2019t set to resume until the end of July and there\u2019s always the chance of further delays.\n\nHarmful industry publicity, as a handful of cruises were left to self-isolate on the high seas for weeks in March, roiled the shares. Then, difficult to navigate, socially distanced policies cast doubt on most vacationing, let alone on a ship in the middle of the ocean. Consequently, it should come as little surprise that the broader market\u2019s dazzling recovery hasn\u2019t proven nearly as rewarding for longer-term shareholders of Royal Caribbean.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDespite the stock enriching a few investors as it more than doubled in price from its absolute low on March 18, RCL remains underwater by nearly 70% year-to-date. Shares are also trading at stock prices first reached more than 20 years ago.\n\nConfidence Boost\n\nThe good news is Wednesday night\u2019s earnings release hints that Royal Caribbean\u2019s current stranding isn\u2019t likely to turn into a deeper and inescapable sinking.\n\nReaction to RCL\u2019s report was good in Thursday\u2019s session. That\u2019s not to say heavy quarterly losses and dismal-sounding declines in sales weren\u2019t announced. They were. But investors are resting easier following some confidence-boosting clarity from management.\n\nShares ended the session firmly higher by about 6.5% after being up more than 10%. A water-logged performance in the broader averages, as well as the weight of a couple market leaders like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH), brought indexes below the water line.\n\nHighlights from the quarterly announcement included much-needed liquidity reassurances from management. Following a recent capital raise of more than $3.3 billion, the company stressed its ability to stay afloat for an entire year even if operations remain on hold. Further, access to additional funding is available, if required. That\u2019s certainly good news given Royal Caribbean\u2019s credit downgrade last week to a junk bond rating in the aftermath of tapping the debt markets.\n\nLastly, RCL is seeing surprisingly strong new advanced organic bookings. And with management guiding expectations that reasonable load numbers of 30% to 50% should allow for an EBITA profit once operations are resumed, Thursday\u2019s bid has some good-looking supports behind it.\n\nRCL Stock Monthly Stock Chart\n\n\n\nSource: Charts by TradingView\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the RCL price chart, investors electing to board the stock as an investment should be prepared for volatility.

Both are hanging by a thread, hoping for a future return to normalcy.\n\nThe vultures are circling both sectors. On May 5, Norwegian Cruise Lines (NYSE:NCLH) publicly raised the possibility of bankruptcy. Globally, several airlines have already declared bankruptcy as a result of the pandemic, including Flybe and Virgin Australia.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nU.S. airlines have a huge problem that the cruise lines don\u2019t. While cruise lines are docking their ships to wait out the storm, U.S. airlines must continue flying. Even with passenger volume down by as much as 95% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Part of their fleet can be grounded, but service must continue, and that means huge operational costs continue. American Airlines has reportedly been burning through $70 million a day since the crisis began.\n\nIs it any wonder AAL stock is sitting at lows not seen since 2013?\n\nWhat About Government Bailouts?\n\nCruise lines were ineligible for government funding under the CARES Act. Incorporating offshore brought them big tax advantages, but cost them any shot at receiving assistance.\n\nAirlines did get money. Of the $2 trillion in funding, $58 billion was earmarked for keeping the airlines afloat. American Airlines received a $4.1 billion grant and $1.7 billion in loans. But the assistance came with big catches. Companies accepting CARES funding are banned from share buybacks for the term of the loan plus one year, and can\u2019t issue dividends. In addition, the government funds are aimed at keeping staff employed. And to be eligible, airlines must keep flying domestically, which brings us back to those killer operating costs.\n\nThe \u2018New Normal\u2019 for Air Travel Doesn\u2019t Look Pretty\n\nAmerican Airlines is taking measures to reduce risk, and to reassure passengers that it is safe to fly. In May, it began distributing face masks and sanitizing wipes to passengers. Flight attendants were required to wear face masks. Food and beverage service was suspended on domestic flights. Its planes have been undergoing thorough cleaning after every flight, including disinfecting any surfaces passengers may have touched. Social distancing is enforced in airports, at ticket counters and during boarding.\n\nAll of these measures mean added cost. Some are intrusive enough to have the opposite effect and discourage some passengers from flying. In addition, there is pressure for additional safety measures ranging from passenger temperature checks to flying planes with seats empty to provide distance between passengers.\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil an effective COVID-19 vaccine is brought to market and the pandemic brought under control, none of this may be enough. Robert Reich, a noted University of California at Berkeley professor told CNBC:\n\n\u201cMany people are not going to feel safe going back to crowded airplanes \u2026 until they see that the number of new deaths from the virus has gone down to almost none in their region, or until there is a vaccine or much better ways of tracing and isolating who has it.\u201d"}, "no_of_news": 7, "plot_name": "/content/plots/NCLH.png"}, "BABA": {"company_name": "Alibaba Group Holding Limited", "News 1": {"title": "\u2018It\u2019s time for China to blink first,\u2019 says Rep.

Investments into new realms like artificial intelligence and autonomous driving have yet to bear fruit. Its other major sales contributor, iQiyi Inc., a video-streaming platform that listed separately on Nasdaq in March 2018, continues to lose money.\n\nAround the time that Li complained foreign investors weren\u2019t getting it, some of his contemporaries decided to move home where they felt Chinese investors had a better understanding and would reward them with higher valuations. Internet security company Qihoo 360 Technology Co. was taken private by a consortium that included Citic Group for $9.3 billion in December 2015. It relisted in Shanghai in 2018 via the purchase of elevator maker SJEC Corp., and now trades under the name 360 Security Technology Inc. Chinese investors have soured on 360 Security, pushing the company\u2019s market value down by more than a third since February.\n\nThere\u2019s a warning for Li. Investors in China won\u2019t assign a higher valuation to a returning company unless it has a convincing growth story to tell. Baidu was a pioneer when it listed on Nasdaq in 2005, paving the way for dozens of Chinese internet stocks to follow. Touted as the Google of China, it symbolized the potential of the sector for American investors. Those days are long gone: Baidu has been eclipsed as China\u2019s technology darling by fasting-growing companies such as Alibaba and Tencent.\n\nThe problem for Li isn\u2019t that investors don\u2019t understand his business. It may be that they understand it too well.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nTim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

Even though it isn't the intention, these filings to a certain extent level the playing field for ordinary investors. The latest round of 13F filings disclosed the funds' positions on March 31st, about a week after the S&P 500 Index bottomed. We at Insider Monkey have made an extensive database of more than 821 of those established hedge funds and famous value investors' filings. In this article, we analyze how these elite funds and prominent investors traded Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) based on those filings.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) shareholders have witnessed a decrease in hedge fund sentiment of late. Our calculations also showed that BABA is still ranked #4 among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings and see the video for a quick look at the top 5 stocks).\n\nVideo: Watch our video about the top 5 most popular hedge fund stocks.\n\nIf you'd ask most market participants, hedge funds are viewed as unimportant, old investment vehicles of the past. While there are more than 8000 funds in operation at present, Our researchers hone in on the leaders of this group, approximately 850 funds. These hedge fund managers have their hands on the majority of all hedge funds' total asset base, and by keeping track of their highest performing stock picks, Insider Monkey has uncovered a few investment strategies that have historically outrun Mr. Market. Insider Monkey's flagship short hedge fund strategy beat the S&P 500 short ETFs by around 20 percentage points a year since its inception in March 2017. Our portfolio of short stocks lost 36% since February 2017 (through May 18th) even though the market was up 30% during the same period.

For example, we believe electric vehicles and energy storage are set to become giant markets, and we want to take advantage of the declining lithium prices amid the COVID-19 pandemic. So we asked astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson about Tesla, Elon Musk, and his top stock picks. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. Our best call in 2020 was shorting the market when S&P 500 was trading at 3150 after realizing the coronavirus pandemic\u2019s significance before most investors. Now we're going to view the key hedge fund action encompassing Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA).\n\nWhat does smart money think about Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)?\n\nHeading into the second quarter of 2020, a total of 167 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock, a change of -2% from the previous quarter. By comparison, 117 hedge funds held shares or bullish call options in BABA a year ago. With hedgies' sentiment swirling, there exists a few key hedge fund managers who were boosting their holdings meaningfully (or already accumulated large positions).\n\nIs BABA A Good Stock To Buy? More\n\nAmong these funds, Fisher Asset Management held the most valuable stake in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), which was worth $2579.7 million at the end of the third quarter. On the second spot was GQG Partners which amassed $1690.5 million worth of shares. Lone Pine Capital, Citadel Investment Group, and Tiger Global Management LLC were also very fond of the stock, becoming one of the largest hedge fund holders of the company.

Neither nation is part of these manufacturing agreements. China also isn\u2019t listed.\n\nGilead said the licenses will be considered royalty-free until one of two things happens: the World Health Organization lifts its declaration of a public health emergency of international concern, or another drug or vaccine is approved.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, canceled a $55.5 million contract for respiratory face masks made with a small Virginia company that had no experience in the mask business and a parent that was in bankruptcy, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe no-bid contract, with Panthera Worldwide LLC, was one of the largest mask orders signed by FMEA as it scrambled to find masks and other personal protective equipment.\n\nA FEMA spokeswoman said the contract for 10 million N95 masks was canceled Tuesday \u201con the grounds of nondelivery.\u201d FEMA has said it wouldn\u2019t pay Panthera until the masks were delivered.\n\nPanthera\u2019s two owners have been accused of fraud in lawsuits by business associates \u2014 which the owners deny \u2014 and both had IRS tax liens filed against them in 2018 for alleged unpaid taxes, the Wall Street Journal reported last month.\n\nWhat\u2019s the economy saying?\n\nThe wholesale cost of U.S. goods and services sank 1.3% in April \u2014 the largest decline on record \u2014 as the coronavirus bore down on the economy and cratered demand, as MarketWatch\u2019s Jeffry Bartash reported.\n\nIt was the third straight decline and the biggest since the government reconfigured its wholesale report in 2009 to include services such as finance and health care. Economists polled by MarketWatch had predicted a 0.5% drop.\n\nThe rate of wholesale inflation in the past year also turned negative for the first time since 2015, tumbling to negative 1.2% in April from a small increase in March, the government said Wednesday.\n\nMuch of the decline was due to the slump in oil prices amid oversupply as those with cars are not using them or driving them significantly less.\n\n\u201cThe core PPI will not continue falling at this pace, but the virus will remain a sustained disinflationary shock long after the initial hit from the lockdown has largely reversed,\u201d said chief economist Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nSee:Three stunning charts from U.K. GDP \u2014 including the spike in toilet paper demand\n\nWhat are companies saying?\n\nTesla Inc.

GRUB, +1.79% were called a \u201cnew low in pandemic profiteering\u201d by a member of Congress on Tuesday, and that\u2019s just one issue that could thwart a potential combination of the food-delivery companies, as MarketWatch\u2019s Therese Poletti writes.\n\nJust hours after a Wall Street Journal report revealed the talks, Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island, slammed the deal, which has support on Wall Street.\n\n\u201cUber is a notoriously predatory company that has long denied its drivers a living wage. Its attempt to acquire Grubhub \u2014 which has a history of exploiting local restaurants through deceptive tactics and extortionate fees \u2014 marks a new low in pandemic profiteering,\u201d Cicilline, who is the House antitrust subcommittee\u2019s chairman, said in a statement.\n\nElsewhere, there was a flurry of bond offerings announced early Wednesday, as companies move to bolster liquidity and conserve cash during the pandemic.\n\nHere are the latest things companies have said about COVID-19:\n\n\u2022 Boyd Gaming Corp. BYD, -0.40% is offering $500 million of senior notes that mature in 2025 in a private placement. The Las Vegas\u2013based company will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including working capital.

BDX, +0.13% is offering $1.5 billion in 10-year and 30-year notes, as the medical technology company looks to repay $1 billion in debt due this year. The offerings include $750 million in 2.823% notes due 2030 and $750 million in 3.794% notes due 2050. That compares with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note of 0.678% and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond of 1.381%. The company said it expects to use the proceeds plus cash on hand to repay the $1 billion in 2.404% notes due 2020, and to fund a partial redemption of its 3.250% notes, also due this year.\n\n\u2022 The Container Store Group Inc. TCS, +3.21% expects fourth-fiscal-quarter sales of $241.3 million, down 4.7% from a year ago, mostly because of the pandemic. Same-store sales are expected to fall 3.6%. The quarter was tracking the company\u2019s \u201cexpectations\u201d until the last few weeks of the period, when store closures and other business disruption started. Analysts polled by FactSet expect fourth-quarter sales around $250 million. The retailer is expected to report a complete fourth-quarter picture next week. The Container Store had a cash balance of about $67.8 million at the end of March. Total debt, net of deferred financing costs, was $333.5 million, and liquidity was $96.4 million at the end of the quarter.\n\n\u2022 DraftKings Inc. shares DKNG, +1.96% rallied after reports emerged that famed investor George Soros owns 2.7 million shares of the Class A stock through an investment vehicle called Quantum Partners. DraftKings disclosed the holding in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week. Other investors include Walt Disney Co. DIS, +0.16% , which operates the sports channel EPSN, and the National Hockey League.\n\n\u2022 Networking company Infinera Corp. INFN, -0.86% reported larger quarterly losses than expected amid the pandemic. Infinera, which mostly sells networking equipment to telecommunications firms, reported a first-quarter loss of $99.3 million, or 55 cents a share, on sales of $330.3 million, up from $292.7 million a year ago. After removing some costs, including some related to COVID-19, the company claimed a loss of 27 cents a share, worse than a loss of 23 cents a share in the same quarter a year ago. Analysts had projected an adjusted loss of 18 cents a share on sales of $318.3 million, after Infinera guided for adjusted losses of 15 cents to 21 cents a share. Infinera guided for second-quarter sales of $309 million to $329 million with negative operating margins.\n\n\u2022 Live Nation Entertainment Inc. LYV, +2.10% is planning to issue $800 million in senior secured notes that mature in 2027 in a private deal. The ticketing company said it would use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.\n\n\u2022 Plug Power Inc. PLUG, -1.43% is offering $200 million in convertible senior notes that mature in 2025 in a private offering. Proceeds of the deal will be used to fund capped call transactions that seek to minimize dilution once the bonds convert into stock, and for \u201celigible green projects,\u201d the maker of hydrogen and fuel-cell technology said. The notes will be convertible into cash, common stock or a combination, at Plug Power\u2019s discretion.\n\n\u2022 Potbelly Corp. PBPB, -8.08% reported a wider quarterly loss and sales that were below Wall Street expectations even as its delivery, drive-through and takeout sales rose 45% in April. \u201cSimply put, the pandemic arrested the strong turnaround momentum we initiated in [the fourth quarter],\u201d Chief Executive Alan Johnson said. \u201cWe understand challenges will persist over the next several months, and are taking the necessary steps to support and fortify our business.\u201d Potbelly drew down its $40 million credit facility and cut costs and expenses, it said. It is negotiating with landlords and considering closing up to 100 shops, the company said.\n\n\u2022 Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL, -0.48% launched a private offering of $3.3 billion in senior secured notes due 2023 and 2025. The notes will be backed by 28 of its vessels and intellectual property. The company expects to use the proceeds from the offering to repay its $2.35 billion, 364-day term loan agreement, that was disclosed on March 23. The remainder of the proceeds is expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which could include repayment of other debt.\n\n\u2022 Twitter Inc.\u2019s TWTR, +0.86% nearly 5,000 employees may work from home as long as they wish as the San Francisco-based company re-engineers operations in the age of COVID-19. Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey told employees in a note Tuesday that most of them would be allowed to continue to work from home even after the global health crisis passes. Those who return to the office will not be allowed to until at least September, and all travel will be severely cut back, Dorsey added.\n\n\u2022 Uber Technologies Inc. and Grubhub Inc. cannot agree on a price that the ride-hailing company would pay to acquire the food-delivery business, according to a CNBC report. The business channel said that Uber had rejected an all-stock offer. Earlier Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Grubhub proposed a deal in which its investors would have received 2.15 Uber shares for every share of Grubhub, valuing the company at roughly $6.25 billion. The Journal also reported that Uber\u2019s board was expected to review the proposal in the \u201ccoming days.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Walt Disney Co. disclosed the maturities of a six-part bond deal the media and theme-park company announced plans for earlier this week, with maturities ranging from six years to 40 years.

Excluding coronavirus-related provisions, net income would have been INR32.60 billion ($431 million).\n\n\n\nThe results were driven by a rise in revenues, loans and deposits. However, provisions surged owing to coronavirus-related concerns. Further, an increase in operating expenses was a headwind.\n\n\n\nRevenue Components Improve, Expenses Rise\n\n\n\nNet interest income (NII) rose 17% year over year to INR89.27 billion ($1.2 billion). Excluding the interest on income tax refund, NII increased 24% from the prior-year quarter.

Both the ratios were well above the minimum requirements.\n\n\n\nOur Take\n\n\n\nICICI Bank\u2019s quarterly performance was decent. Growth in revenues was a major tailwind, which is expected to support the company's financial performance going forward.

Its performance was supported by higher net interest income, and net fee and commission income. However, higher expenses dragged down growth.\n\n\n\nHSBC Holdings\u2019 HSBC first-quarter 2020 pre-tax profit of $3.2 billion represents a 48% decline from the prior-year reported number. The reduction primarily reflects the impact of the coronavirus outbreak and weakening of oil prices.\n\n\n\nBarclays\u2019 BCS first-quarter 2020 net income attributable to ordinary equity holders of \u00a3605 million ($774.6 million) represents a 41.7% year-over-year decline. The results were primarily hurt by a significant increase in credit impairment charges. Also, the company\u2019s top line declined in the quarter. Nonetheless, marginally lower operating expenses and a strong balance sheet position were tailwinds.\n\n\n\nMore Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!\n\n\n\nIt could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

The nearest support level for the pair is located at 1.2170.\n\nIf this level is breached to the downside, GBP/USD will gain additional downside momentum and head towards the next support level at the low of the recent downside move at 1.2080.\n\nI\u2019d note that failure to settle above 1.2250 is a bearish signal for GBP/USD, so the downside scenario is more likely at this point.\n\nOn the upside, the pair will have to deal with the major resistance at 1.2250 and the resistance at the 20 EMA at 1.2280. Most likely, the whole area between 1.2250 and 1.2280 will serve as a material resistance area for GBP/USD.\n\nIf the pair gets above this level, it will gain upside momentum and head towards the next resistance level at the 50 EMA at 1.2360.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:"}, "no_of_news": 7, "plot_name": "/content/fx_plots/GBPUSD=X.png"}, "EURJPY=X": {"currency_pair": "EUR/JPY", "News 1": {"title": "Morgan Stanley says it's now neutral on euro due to the French-German recovery fund proposal", "keywords": ["frenchgerman", "catalyst", "neutral", "trade", "recovery", "yen", "euro", "risk", "proposal", "stanley", "morgan", "fund", "vs", "downside"], "publish_date": "2020-05-21", "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/morgan-stanley-says-its-now-neutral-on-euro-due-to-the-french-german-recovery-fund-proposal-2020-05-21?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo", "summary": "Morgan Stanley said it's turned neutral on the euro due to what it said was the \"bold\" Franco-German proposal for a 500 billion euro recovery fund, saying the \"proposal takes out the downside tail risk for the euro and euro crosses.\"\nIt no longer recommends a short euro vs. Japanese yen EURJPY, +0.00% trade and says the euro vs. the dollar EURUSD, -0.07% \"could trade in the 1.0690-1.1150 range for some time but is now more likely to break out to the upside than the downside.\"\nEquity investors should view the proposed recovery fund primarily as a potential catalyst to drive regional risk premia lower, rather than a catalyst for stronger growth, the bank said.", "text": "Morgan Stanley said it's turned neutral on the euro due to what it said was the \"bold\" Franco-German proposal for a 500 billion euro recovery fund, saying the \"proposal takes out the downside tail risk for the euro and euro crosses.\" It no longer recommends a short euro vs. Japanese yen EURJPY, +0.00% trade and says the euro vs. the dollar EURUSD, -0.07% \"could trade in the 1.0690-1.1150 range for some time but is now more likely to break out to the upside than the downside.\" Equity investors should view the proposed recovery fund primarily as a potential catalyst to drive regional risk premia lower, rather than a catalyst for stronger growth, the bank said."}, "no_of_news": 1, "plot_name": "/content/fx_plots/EURJPY=X.png"}}, "INDICES": {"^DJI": {"Index Name": "Dow Jones Industrial Average", "News 1": {"title": "Dow Jones Futures: Breakouts Slowing In Coronavirus Stock Market Rally, But Apple, Tesla, AMD Near Buy Points", "keywords": ["stocks", "points", "dow", "slowing", "jones", "amd", "rally", "week", "line", "futures", "market", "tesla", "stock", "coronavirus", "near", "buy"], "publish_date": "2020-05-25", "url": "https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-futures-coronavirus-stock-market-rally-apple-tesla-amd-buy-points/?src=A00220&yptr=yahoo", "summary": "Apple stock, Microsoft stock and AMD stock are on IBD Leaderboard.\nStock Market Update: The Bull Rages To Higher GroundCoronavirus Stock Market RallyThe coronavirus stock market rally quietly had another strong week.\nThe S&P 500 confirmed the coronavirus stock market rally on April 2, with the Nasdaq following through on April 6.\nBut moved higher during the market crash and the coronavirus stock market rally.\nThe real concern with AMD stock isn't its performance vs. the broader stock market rally but relative to other data-center chip stocks.", "text": "Dow Jones futures rose modestly Sunday night, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures.

Covid-19 deaths are above 346,000.\n\nCoronavirus cases in the U.S. are at 1.68 million, with deaths topping 99,000.\n\nA big question is whether states reopening economies will push up coronavirus cases. So far that hasn't happened, though there would be lag. Most of the reopening moves are incremental, while mask wearing and other social-distancing efforts, along with spring-summer weather may help suppress transmission rates.\n\nIf new cases, hospitalizations and deaths trend lower, states will be able to further reopen, providing a bigger lift to the economy and coronavirus stock market rally. If Covid-19 trends worsen, states may keep a relatively tight lid on activity.\n\nMemorial Day weekend is a big test, with many people in crowds or traveling in greater numbers than at any point since the coronavirus crisis hit the U.S.\n\nThe silver bullet for the coronavirus pandemic and an economic recovery is a vaccine. There are hopeful signs for some vaccine candidates, with buzz that some may be ready later this year. But everything has to go right. A coronavirus vaccine, especially for the broad public, may not be ready until late 2021 or beyond.\n\nThe U.S. is barring entry of all foreigners who've been in Brazil within the prior 14 days, the White House said Sunday.\n\nBrazil has now passed Russia for the second-most coronavirus cases, with both countries continuing add a large number of new infections every day. Coronavirus testing is very low in Brazil. Several other Latin American countries, India and much of the Middle East are showing big increases in Covid-19 cases.\n\nStock Market Update: The Bull Rages To Higher Ground\n\nCoronavirus Stock Market Rally\n\nThe coronavirus stock market rally quietly had another strong week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 3.3%, the S&P 500 index 3.2% and the Nasdaq composite 3.4%. The Nasdaq composite is getting close to record highs, while the S&P 500 index is close to its 200-day line. The 50-day moving averages for the Dow and S&P 500 have now turned up.\n\nApple stock rose 3.6% last week, outpacing the major indexes. Microsoft nudged up just 0.2%. Both AAPL stock and MSFT stock are members of the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq.\n\nAmong the best ETFs, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) rose 3.5%, with MSFT stock as the No. 1 holding. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) surged 5.2%. AMD and Nvdia stock are key components.\n\nRecent breakouts have continued to shine, including Nvidia stock, Twilio (TWLO), Chipotle (CMG) and Datadog (DDOG).\n\nBut while Facebook (FB) and ASML (ASML) powered higher last week, the number of new breakouts has dwindled. That's especially surprising. The S&P 500 confirmed the coronavirus stock market rally on April 2, with the Nasdaq following through on April 6. The powerful rally has propelled dozens of growth stocks past buy points and hasn't paused for any significant length of time for those leaders to set up new bases.\n\nThat's good news for investors who jumped into early breakouts, but the pickings are slimmer now.\n\nA key reason to investors to start when there's a follow-through day is because the big winners of a stock market rally often break out in those first few weeks. Another reason is that breakouts can be harder to find after several weeks of a market rally.\n\nRead The Big Picture every day to stay in sync with the market direction and leading stocks and sectors.\n\nApple Stock\n\nApple stock rose 3.6% to 318.89 last week. That's just below a 319.79 buy point, though AAPL stock did hit 320.89 intraday Thursday. On a daily chart, 319.79 an alternate entry after clearing a cup-with-handle buy point of 288.35 at the end of April. On a weekly chart, that earlier handle didn't appear, so 319.79 is a conventional cup-with-handle buy point for AAPL stock.\n\nThe relative strength line for Apple stock is right at record highs. The RS line, the blue line in the charts below, reflects a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. It's a good way to spot leading stocks in good markets or bad.\n\nAAPL stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 93.\n\nMicrosoft Stock\n\nMicrosoft stock rose just 0.2% to 183.51 last week. That's still in buy range from a 180.10 handle entry on what's either a cup or double-bottom pattern. So investors could buy MSFT stock right here. But shares clearly seem to hitting some resistance. In fact, Microsoft stock now has a three-weeks-tight formation.\n\nA three-weeks-tight is when a stock breaks out, advances some distance, then trades tightly for a few weeks. The stock must have weekly closes within 1%-1.5% of the prior week for two straight weeks. The buy point is 10 cents above the high of the three-weeks-tight. That gives a 187.61 entry in this case.\n\nTypically, a three-weeks-tight is a place for existing investors to add a few more shares. But given that MSFT stock is still in the broader base, one could treat this three-weeks-tight as another handle, offering a chance to start a new position.\n\nThe RS line has drifted lower for the past couple of weeks as Microsoft stock consolidates. But moved higher during the market crash and the coronavirus stock market rally.\n\nMicrosoft was Thursday's IBD Stock Of The Day.\n\nMSFT stock has a best-possible 99 Composite Rating.\n\nGoogle Stock\n\nGoogle stock climbed 2.9% last week to 1,413.24, hitting 1,147 shortly before Friday's close. GOOGL stock has a 1,415.63 cup-with-handle buy point, according to MarketSmith analysis.\n\nThe RS for Google stock is right at highs, with solid gains since earnings on April 28. But Google stock has not been a big winner over the past few years.\n\nGOOGL stock was Friday's IBD Stock Of The Day.\n\nGoogle stock has a 96 Composite Rating.\n\nTesla Stock\n\nTesla stock rose 2.2% to 816.88 last week. TSLA stock, which has been very volatile in 2020, has been trading very tightly in the past few weeks. Another positive sign is that the RS line for Tesla stock is right at record highs.\n\nTesla stock has a handle buy point of 869.92. On Thursday, shares appeared to nudge past a downward-sloping trend line, but then fell slightly Friday. Investors probably should wait for Tesla stock to clear at least 843.39 (just above the May 12 peak) or the traditional handle entry of 869.92.\n\nThere is a wedge-like feel to the TSLA handle, so a short-term pullback could be healthy, whether to the 21-day moving average, below the May 13 low or even to near the May 1 low of 683.04. That would shake out some weak holders.\n\nBut Tesla stock is going to do what it's going to do.\n\nTSLA stock has a 97 Composite Rating.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla's business is far more uncertain than the other companies on the list. A severe recession and high-income people often working from home isn't a great recipe for luxury auto demand, while Tesla is losing market share in Europe, where electric vehicle competition is expanding rapidly.\n\nAMD Stock\n\nAMD stock rose 1.8% to 55.17 last week, moving toward a 58.73 cup-with-handle buy point. Like Tesla stock, AMD ticked past a short trend line early entry but backed off. Investors should probably wait to clear Tuesday's peak of 56.98 or simply wait for a traditional breakout.\n\nAfter a six-month run to mid-April, the RS line for AMD stock has backed off, but not much.\n\nThe real concern with AMD stock isn't its performance vs. the broader stock market rally but relative to other data-center chip stocks. Nvidia stock, Inphi (IPHI) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) all have broken out and risen rapidly while AMD moves sideways.\n\nAMD stock has a perfect 99 Composite Rating.\n\nPlease follow Ed Carson on Twitter at @IBD_ECarson for stock market updates and more.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nFive Healthy Stocks To Buy Or Watch\n\nThis May Be The Most Important Investing Lesson You Ever Learn\n\nViral Caution Turns To Gold For These Mining Stocks\n\nBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch\n\nIBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis Today"}, "News 2": {"title": "Are stock investors too complacent about a full-scale blowup between China and the U.S.?

Here\u2019s everything investors need to know about Memorial Day trading hours and closures\n\nIndeed, caustic rhetoric between the No. 1 and 2 economies in the world is intensifying \u2014 again.\n\nIt may feel as if the animus between the global superpowers couldn\u2019t come at a more inopportune time: in the middle of a pandemic, which notably was first identified in Wuhan, China in December, and has infected more than 5 million people around the world, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University.\n\nAs MarketWatch\u2019s sister publication Barron\u2019s writes, the Sino-American issues are many and include actions taken by the U.S. to censure China\u2019s new security rules that threaten Hong Kong\u2019s semiautonomous status, restrictions against Huawei Technologies, a push to increase scrutiny of Chinese companies listed in the U.S., funding for the World Health Organization, and accountability for the handling of the viral outbreak that has likely ushered in one of the most severe global recessions in the past 100 years.\n\n\u201cThe list is long as my arm,\u201d said Ian Bremmer, Eurasia Group\u2019s founder and president, of the Sino-American tensions, during a Friday interview on CNBC.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never a good thing that the two largest economies in the world are battling,\u201d Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of Bleakley Advisory Group, told MarketWatch in an emailed exchange on Friday.\n\nTensions between the countries, however, don\u2019t seem to have supplanted the intense investor focus on reopening the economy in the U.S., and elsewhere in the world, or attention on a cure for the COVID-19 pandemic, which have helped to buoy risk assets.\n\n\u201cI think the market likely sees the upside risk related to finding a vaccine or treatment as near-term, and the downside risk related to China as long-term, so they are focusing more on the near-term right now,\u201d Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist with Ally Invest, told MarketWatch on Friday.\n\nOn Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, DJIA, -0.03% the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.23% , the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.42% logged lackluster moves, even as the indexes all notched weekly gains of more than 3%.\n\nThe small-capitalization Russell 2000 index RUT, +0.59% surged 7.6% for the week, suggesting that investors were scooping up smaller-cap companies, more sensitive to economic vagaries, just in case efforts to restart businesses proved successful.\n\n\u201c \u2018The economic recovery is still very fragile and any larger repercussions between the U.S. and China could put a halt to the equity rally quite quickly.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial\n\nThe overall action in U.S. stocks has tilted higher since the indexes put in March 23 lows but has become more cautious as catalysts to take stocks substantially in either direction for a sustained period have failed to materialize.\n\nCould China and U.S. tensions ultimately trigger a fresh eruption? It\u2019s impossible to know how this current political situation will play out, but the conflict bears watching, some experts say.\n\n\u201cThe renewed tension between the U.S. and China certainly reignites a risk to the market that had taken a bit of a back burner during the pandemic crisis,\u201d Katie Nixon, CIO at Northern Trust Wealth Management, told MarketWatch.\n\n\u201cComing in the midst of a recession, we expect that these tensions will contribute to market volatility, particularly as we head toward the U.S. Presidential election,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAfter a 30% plus rally from the March lows, the bar is definitely much higher. As the worries with China heat up, we do think investors could be a little too complacent here and now,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial.\n\n\u201cThe economic recovery is still very fragile and any larger repercussions between the U.S. and China could put a halt to the equity rally quite quickly,\u201d he told MarketWatch.\n\nCheck out: Stock market traders brace for \u2018dogfight\u2019 as S&P 500 lingers below its 200-day moving average\n\nWith 2020 being a presidential election year in the U.S., some strategists note that the U.S.-China relationship may serve as a centerpiece on the virtual campaign trail.\n\nEvercore IS analysts Sarah Bianchi and Don Straszheim say that since January, the share of U.S. voters who say China is an \u201cenemy\u201d has risen to 31%, while the percent who say China is either an ally or friend has fallen to 23%.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump needs to increase turnout of his base voters in Michigan, Wisconsin or Pennsylvania to secure reelection and this issue provides the perfect fodder,\u201d the analysts write in a summary of recent discussion on the role of China policy in the election.\n\n\u201cIt also enables [Trump] to deflect criticism on his COVID-19 response and attack Vice President [Joe] Biden to try to make the election a choice between the two of them \u2014 rather than a referendum on coronavirus,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\n\u201c \u2018I think the next 3-6 weeks could see the most meaningful decline since the March 23 bear market bottom. If that\u2019s the case, the Dow should breach its May low and head to 22,000 at a minimum.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Paul Schatz, the president of Heritage Capital\n\nOther strategists make the case that the U.S. is likely to rework its supply chains away from China, on the heels of its phase-one trade agreement. If that is to be believed then the continuing China strife may be less of impact, some speculate.\n\n\u201cMy view has been and continues to be that we will launch an aggressive plan to rebuild supply chains over here (along with infrastructure spending),\u201d Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities, explained to MarketWatch.\n\n\u201cSo, from a markets standpoint I think partly noise, but more because we will be heading away from China anyway,\u201d he said.\n\nReworking supply chains may assume that the global economy returns to some semblance of normalcy in the wake of the world-wide public-health crisis.\n\nIn any case, Paul Schatz, the president of Heritage Capital, told MarketWatch that investors should brace for an equity slump in the next few weeks that could be triggered by disappointment about reopening the economy or some other catalyst.\n\n\u201cI think the next 3-6 weeks could see the most meaningful decline since the March 23 bear market bottom. If that\u2019s the case, the Dow should breach its May low and head to 22,000 at a minimum,\u201d he said.\n\nThat said, Schatz is upbeat on the market over the longer term and predicts that the Dow will hit 30,000 and the overall market will be \u201cdouble-digits higher\u201d in the coming 9-12 month period.\n\nAs for China, Schatz says he believes Trump is unlikely to jeopardize deepening the economic pain the U.S. is facing by locking horns with his counterpart President Xi Jinping.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Trump et al will do anything to further jeopardize the economy and what will be a nascent recovery.

It dropped 9.5% in April as investors warmed back up to a risk-on approach.\n\nFear of government confiscation, as Bloomberg News explained, is often discussed among serious gold bugs \u2014 it happened in the U.S. in 1933 \u2014 but with major currencies no longer linked to gold, there are no signs such a move is realistically even being considered by central banks.\n\nOdey said he expects the powers-that-be to fight rising inflation \u2014 and lose \u2014 as rates climb as high as 15% within 15 months to weigh heavily on bonds and growth stocks.\n\nAs for Wednesday\u2019s trade, gold prices GC00, -0.49% settled higher for a second session, as economic stimulus measures boosted demand for the precious metal against the backdrop of economies attempting to reopen from the COVID-19 pandemic."}, "News 5": {"title": "The U.S. is in \u2018relative decline\u2019 as \u2018Chinese power is rapidly rising,\u2019 warns Ray Dalio", "keywords": ["chinese", "worlds", "warns", "power", "economy", "relative", "china", "rapidly", "trillion", "decline", "chinas", "states", "gdp", "dalio", "ray", "united", "rising"], "publish_date": "2020-05-21", "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-us-is-now-the-most-powerful-empire-but-it-is-in-relative-decline-as-chinese-power-is-rapidly-rising-says-founder-of-worlds-largest-hedge-fund-2020-05-21?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo", "summary": "The days of U.S. hegemony are numbered and China is waiting in the wings, argues Ray Dalio, in his most recent missive on LinkedIn.\nAt last check, U.S. gross domestic product, or GDP, was at $21.44 trillion on a nominal basis, while China\u2019s GDP was around of $14 trillion.\nBy another measure, known as purchasing power parity, which weighs a country\u2019s respective purchasing power, China\u2019s GDP would be $27.31 trillion, based on data from International Monetary Fund.\nAnd back in February, Elon Musk predicted that the Chinese economy would surpass the U.S. by at least twofold.\n\u201cA thing that will feel pretty strange is that the Chinese economy is probably going to be at least twice as big as the United States\u2019 economy, maybe three times,\u201d he said during a fireside chat in Florida.", "text": "The days of U.S. hegemony are numbered and China is waiting in the wings, argues Ray Dalio, in his most recent missive on LinkedIn.\n\n\u201c \u2018As you can see the United States is now the most powerful empire by not much, it is in relative decline, Chinese power is rapidly rising, and no other powers come close.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe co-chief investment officer and co-chairman of Bridgewater Associates, outlined his case for why the world\u2019s largest economy would be overtaken by China soon, presently the second-largest economy on the planet, with aspirations for much more.\n\nDalio\u2019s comments are part of his series of articles published on LinkedIn.\n\nDalio\u2019s remarks published on Thursday come as Sino-American tensions are ratcheting higher and creating some friction for the stock market, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03% , the S&P 500 SPX, +0.23% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.42% rattled by renewed testiness between the global superpowers.\n\nIndeed, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that U.S. senators are introducing a bipartisan bill that would sanction Chinese party officials and entities who enforce the new national-security laws in Hong Kong.\n\nThat proposal comes as President Donald Trump claimed China\u2019s \u201cdisinformation and propaganda attack on the United States and Europe is a disgrace,\u201d in a late-Wednesday missive on Twitter.\n\nThe U.S. has blamed China for mishandling the COVID-19 pandemic, which was first identified in Wuhan in December and has since infected more than 5 million people and claimed nearly 330,000 lives globally, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University as of Thursday afternoon.\n\nChina has defended its response, with Cui Tiankai, China\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., in an op-ed in the Washington Post earlier this month, saying that blaming Beijing \u2018won\u2019t end the pandemic.\u2019\n\nOn Wednesday, the Senate passed a bill that could force Chinese companies to give up their listings on American stock exchanges under legislation approved by the Senate on Wednesday, further elevating the animus between the No. 1 and 2 economies.\n\nDalio thinks that China is on a better footing and may soon surpass the U.S. The wealthy investor whose net worth is estimated to be $18 billion, according to Forbes data, isn\u2019t the first to make such a prediction and he isn\u2019t even the most audacious one to so.\n\nThere has been a sweeping assumption that China will eventually eclipse the U.S.\u2019s economic dominance in real terms.

That left it with an acquisition war chest of around $12 billion in cash.\n\nHowever, Malone\u2019s ambitions in Europe were dealt a blow in October when Liberty was forced to scrap the attempted $6.4 billion sale of its Swiss cable business UPC to Sunrise SRCG, +0.18% after Germany\u2019s Freenet \u2014 Sunrise\u2019s biggest shareholder with 25% of the stock \u2014 vociferously opposed the deal.\n\nFor Telef\u00f3nica, the deal comes just six months after the company announced a sweeping restructuring of its business designed to focus investment on its four key markets: Spain, Brazil, the U.K. and Germany, where it operates under the O2 brand.\n\nThe plan involved grouping together the remaining eight Latin American markets in which it operates, including Mexico, Argentina and Colombia, into a separate division.

There were just $789.8 billion in deals announced worldwide during the first four months of 2020, down 39% compared with last year and the lowest year-to-date level since 2013, according to data from Refinitiv.\n\nLiberty Global bought Virgin Media, which offers pay-television, broadband and phone packages in the U.K., in a cash-and-stock deal worth $23.3 billion in 2013. In the U.K., Virgin competes with Sky, which is owned by Comcast CMCSA, -0.53% , in pay TV, and with BT and Sky in broadband.\n\nThe deal would be a blow to Vodafone, which last year signed a deal with Virgin Media in the U.K. for the two companies to use each other\u2019s networks from 2022. \u201cA merger would mean that Vodafone faces a stronger converged competitor,\u201d Goldman analysts said.

So far that hasn't happened, though there would be lag. Most of the reopening moves are incremental, while mask wearing and other social-distancing efforts, along with spring-summer weather may help suppress transmission rates.\n\nIf new cases, hospitalizations and deaths trend lower, states will be able to further reopen, providing a bigger lift to the economy and coronavirus stock market rally.

Coronavirus testing is very low in Brazil. Several other Latin American countries, India and much of the Middle East are showing big increases in Covid-19 cases.\n\nStock Market Update: The Bull Rages To Higher Ground\n\nCoronavirus Stock Market Rally\n\nThe coronavirus stock market rally quietly had another strong week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 3.3%, the S&P 500 index 3.2% and the Nasdaq composite 3.4%. The Nasdaq composite is getting close to record highs, while the S&P 500 index is close to its 200-day line. The 50-day moving averages for the Dow and S&P 500 have now turned up.\n\nApple stock rose 3.6% last week, outpacing the major indexes. Microsoft nudged up just 0.2%. Both AAPL stock and MSFT stock are members of the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq.\n\nAmong the best ETFs, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) rose 3.5%, with MSFT stock as the No. 1 holding. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) surged 5.2%. AMD and Nvdia stock are key components.\n\nRecent breakouts have continued to shine, including Nvidia stock, Twilio (TWLO), Chipotle (CMG) and Datadog (DDOG).\n\nBut while Facebook (FB) and ASML (ASML) powered higher last week, the number of new breakouts has dwindled. That's especially surprising. The S&P 500 confirmed the coronavirus stock market rally on April 2, with the Nasdaq following through on April 6. The powerful rally has propelled dozens of growth stocks past buy points and hasn't paused for any significant length of time for those leaders to set up new bases.\n\nThat's good news for investors who jumped into early breakouts, but the pickings are slimmer now.\n\nA key reason to investors to start when there's a follow-through day is because the big winners of a stock market rally often break out in those first few weeks. Another reason is that breakouts can be harder to find after several weeks of a market rally.\n\nRead The Big Picture every day to stay in sync with the market direction and leading stocks and sectors.\n\nApple Stock\n\nApple stock rose 3.6% to 318.89 last week. That's just below a 319.79 buy point, though AAPL stock did hit 320.89 intraday Thursday. On a daily chart, 319.79 an alternate entry after clearing a cup-with-handle buy point of 288.35 at the end of April. On a weekly chart, that earlier handle didn't appear, so 319.79 is a conventional cup-with-handle buy point for AAPL stock.\n\nThe relative strength line for Apple stock is right at record highs. The RS line, the blue line in the charts below, reflects a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. It's a good way to spot leading stocks in good markets or bad.\n\nAAPL stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 93.\n\nMicrosoft Stock\n\nMicrosoft stock rose just 0.2% to 183.51 last week. That's still in buy range from a 180.10 handle entry on what's either a cup or double-bottom pattern. So investors could buy MSFT stock right here. But shares clearly seem to hitting some resistance. In fact, Microsoft stock now has a three-weeks-tight formation.\n\nA three-weeks-tight is when a stock breaks out, advances some distance, then trades tightly for a few weeks. The stock must have weekly closes within 1%-1.5% of the prior week for two straight weeks. The buy point is 10 cents above the high of the three-weeks-tight. That gives a 187.61 entry in this case.\n\nTypically, a three-weeks-tight is a place for existing investors to add a few more shares. But given that MSFT stock is still in the broader base, one could treat this three-weeks-tight as another handle, offering a chance to start a new position.\n\nThe RS line has drifted lower for the past couple of weeks as Microsoft stock consolidates. But moved higher during the market crash and the coronavirus stock market rally.\n\nMicrosoft was Thursday's IBD Stock Of The Day.\n\nMSFT stock has a best-possible 99 Composite Rating.\n\nGoogle Stock\n\nGoogle stock climbed 2.9% last week to 1,413.24, hitting 1,147 shortly before Friday's close. GOOGL stock has a 1,415.63 cup-with-handle buy point, according to MarketSmith analysis.\n\nThe RS for Google stock is right at highs, with solid gains since earnings on April 28. But Google stock has not been a big winner over the past few years.\n\nGOOGL stock was Friday's IBD Stock Of The Day.\n\nGoogle stock has a 96 Composite Rating.\n\nTesla Stock\n\nTesla stock rose 2.2% to 816.88 last week. TSLA stock, which has been very volatile in 2020, has been trading very tightly in the past few weeks. Another positive sign is that the RS line for Tesla stock is right at record highs.\n\nTesla stock has a handle buy point of 869.92. On Thursday, shares appeared to nudge past a downward-sloping trend line, but then fell slightly Friday. Investors probably should wait for Tesla stock to clear at least 843.39 (just above the May 12 peak) or the traditional handle entry of 869.92.\n\nThere is a wedge-like feel to the TSLA handle, so a short-term pullback could be healthy, whether to the 21-day moving average, below the May 13 low or even to near the May 1 low of 683.04. That would shake out some weak holders.\n\nBut Tesla stock is going to do what it's going to do.\n\nTSLA stock has a 97 Composite Rating.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla's business is far more uncertain than the other companies on the list. A severe recession and high-income people often working from home isn't a great recipe for luxury auto demand, while Tesla is losing market share in Europe, where electric vehicle competition is expanding rapidly.\n\nAMD Stock\n\nAMD stock rose 1.8% to 55.17 last week, moving toward a 58.73 cup-with-handle buy point. Like Tesla stock, AMD ticked past a short trend line early entry but backed off. Investors should probably wait to clear Tuesday's peak of 56.98 or simply wait for a traditional breakout.\n\nAfter a six-month run to mid-April, the RS line for AMD stock has backed off, but not much.\n\nThe real concern with AMD stock isn't its performance vs. the broader stock market rally but relative to other data-center chip stocks. Nvidia stock, Inphi (IPHI) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) all have broken out and risen rapidly while AMD moves sideways.\n\nAMD stock has a perfect 99 Composite Rating.\n\nPlease follow Ed Carson on Twitter at @IBD_ECarson for stock market updates and more.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nFive Healthy Stocks To Buy Or Watch\n\nThis May Be The Most Important Investing Lesson You Ever Learn\n\nViral Caution Turns To Gold For These Mining Stocks\n\nBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch\n\nIBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis Today"}, "News 2": {"title": "Why Index ETFs Are a New Investor's Best Friend", "keywords": ["best", "stocks", "index", "friend", "investors", "investments", "500", "market", "investing", "etfs", "stock", "invest", "sp"], "publish_date": "2020-05-24", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/24/why-index-etfs-are-a-new-investors-best-friend.aspx?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&yptr=yahoo", "summary": "Fortunately, there are plenty of beginner-friendly investment choices out there, and index ETFs are among the best of the best.\nIndex ETFs (exchange-traded funds) are collections of stocks designed to replicate a particular index, such as the S&P 500 or Dow Jones Industrial Average.\nHow to get started investing in index ETFsThere are countless index ETFs to choose from, so you have plenty of options.\nThere are several index ETFs that track the S&P 500, including Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), Schwab S&P 500 Index Fund (SWPPX), and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV).\nIf the stock market as a whole takes a turn for the worse, your index ETFs likely will as well.", "text": "Investing in the stock market can be daunting, particularly if you're a beginner. Especially right now, when the stock market recently closed out one of its worst first quarters in history due to the coronavirus pandemic, it can be intimidating to figure out where to begin.\n\nHowever, although the stock market will always have its ups and downs, investing is one of best ways to build wealth -- and there's never been a better time to get started. Stock prices are at their lowest during market downturns, meaning you can get more for your money by investing now. It's important to invest wisely, though, because putting your money in the wrong places could be a costly mistake.\n\nFortunately, there are plenty of beginner-friendly investment choices out there, and index ETFs are among the best of the best.\n\nWhat are index ETFs?\n\nIndex ETFs (exchange-traded funds) are collections of stocks designed to replicate a particular index, such as the S&P 500 or Dow Jones Industrial Average. When you invest in an index ETF, you're actually investing in dozens of or even hundreds of different stocks, bonds, and other securities at once. This creates instant diversification, which can significantly limit your risk because even when a handful of stocks in the fund aren't performing well, it won't sink the overall value of the fund.\n\nDiversification is one of the biggest advantages of index ETFs, making these funds perfect for beginners. Timing the market correctly is extremely difficult (even for the experts), and choosing individual stocks to invest in requires loads of research. With index ETFs, however, you can invest in hundreds of stocks at once without having to worry about how each individual stock in the fund is performing.\n\nThe other major benefit with index ETFs is that they are passive investments -- meaning once you start investing, you can essentially \"invest it and forget it.\" You don't need to try to time the market or worry about when to sell. Rather, you can take a hands-off approach and let your investments take care of themselves. Index ETFs are slow but steady, so while you likely won't see dramatic short-term gains, if you leave your money alone long enough, your investments will grow significantly over time.\n\nAnother benefit of passive investments is that you'll typically pay lower fees than if you invest in actively managed mutual funds. Mutual funds are also large collections of stocks and bonds, but they're overseen by a portfolio manager who chooses which investments to include in the fund. Because there's a person managing the investments in the fund, actively managed mutual funds are typically more expensive than passive investments like index ETFs.\n\nHow to get started investing in index ETFs\n\nThere are countless index ETFs to choose from, so you have plenty of options. Many index ETFs also trade for a fraction of the price of the underlying index, making them a great choice for beginners who are just getting their feet wet and don't want to invest a lot of money right now.\n\nOne of the best places to start is by investing in an index ETF that tracks the S&P 500. The S&P 500 encompasses 500 of the largest U.S. companies across various industries, and it's generally considered one of the best representations of the U.S. stock market. There are several index ETFs that track the S&P 500, including Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), Schwab S&P 500 Index Fund (SWPPX), and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV).\n\nNo matter where you choose to invest, there will still be some risk. If the stock market as a whole takes a turn for the worse, your index ETFs likely will as well. But in general, index ETFs are much less risky than holding individual stocks.\n\nGetting started investing in the stock market can be intimidating, but it doesn't have to be. Index ETFs are a great investment choice whether you're a beginner or have been investing for years, and they're a smart option to limit your risk while maximizing your rewards."}, "News 3": {"title": "Are stock investors too complacent about a full-scale blowup between China and the U.S.?

Here\u2019s everything investors need to know about Memorial Day trading hours and closures\n\nIndeed, caustic rhetoric between the No. 1 and 2 economies in the world is intensifying \u2014 again.\n\nIt may feel as if the animus between the global superpowers couldn\u2019t come at a more inopportune time: in the middle of a pandemic, which notably was first identified in Wuhan, China in December, and has infected more than 5 million people around the world, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University.\n\nAs MarketWatch\u2019s sister publication Barron\u2019s writes, the Sino-American issues are many and include actions taken by the U.S. to censure China\u2019s new security rules that threaten Hong Kong\u2019s semiautonomous status, restrictions against Huawei Technologies, a push to increase scrutiny of Chinese companies listed in the U.S., funding for the World Health Organization, and accountability for the handling of the viral outbreak that has likely ushered in one of the most severe global recessions in the past 100 years.\n\n\u201cThe list is long as my arm,\u201d said Ian Bremmer, Eurasia Group\u2019s founder and president, of the Sino-American tensions, during a Friday interview on CNBC.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never a good thing that the two largest economies in the world are battling,\u201d Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of Bleakley Advisory Group, told MarketWatch in an emailed exchange on Friday.\n\nTensions between the countries, however, don\u2019t seem to have supplanted the intense investor focus on reopening the economy in the U.S., and elsewhere in the world, or attention on a cure for the COVID-19 pandemic, which have helped to buoy risk assets.\n\n\u201cI think the market likely sees the upside risk related to finding a vaccine or treatment as near-term, and the downside risk related to China as long-term, so they are focusing more on the near-term right now,\u201d Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist with Ally Invest, told MarketWatch on Friday.\n\nOn Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, DJIA, -0.03% the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.23% , the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.42% logged lackluster moves, even as the indexes all notched weekly gains of more than 3%.\n\nThe small-capitalization Russell 2000 index RUT, +0.59% surged 7.6% for the week, suggesting that investors were scooping up smaller-cap companies, more sensitive to economic vagaries, just in case efforts to restart businesses proved successful.\n\n\u201c \u2018The economic recovery is still very fragile and any larger repercussions between the U.S. and China could put a halt to the equity rally quite quickly.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial\n\nThe overall action in U.S. stocks has tilted higher since the indexes put in March 23 lows but has become more cautious as catalysts to take stocks substantially in either direction for a sustained period have failed to materialize.\n\nCould China and U.S. tensions ultimately trigger a fresh eruption? It\u2019s impossible to know how this current political situation will play out, but the conflict bears watching, some experts say.\n\n\u201cThe renewed tension between the U.S. and China certainly reignites a risk to the market that had taken a bit of a back burner during the pandemic crisis,\u201d Katie Nixon, CIO at Northern Trust Wealth Management, told MarketWatch.\n\n\u201cComing in the midst of a recession, we expect that these tensions will contribute to market volatility, particularly as we head toward the U.S. Presidential election,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAfter a 30% plus rally from the March lows, the bar is definitely much higher. As the worries with China heat up, we do think investors could be a little too complacent here and now,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial.\n\n\u201cThe economic recovery is still very fragile and any larger repercussions between the U.S. and China could put a halt to the equity rally quite quickly,\u201d he told MarketWatch.\n\nCheck out: Stock market traders brace for \u2018dogfight\u2019 as S&P 500 lingers below its 200-day moving average\n\nWith 2020 being a presidential election year in the U.S., some strategists note that the U.S.-China relationship may serve as a centerpiece on the virtual campaign trail.\n\nEvercore IS analysts Sarah Bianchi and Don Straszheim say that since January, the share of U.S. voters who say China is an \u201cenemy\u201d has risen to 31%, while the percent who say China is either an ally or friend has fallen to 23%.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump needs to increase turnout of his base voters in Michigan, Wisconsin or Pennsylvania to secure reelection and this issue provides the perfect fodder,\u201d the analysts write in a summary of recent discussion on the role of China policy in the election.\n\n\u201cIt also enables [Trump] to deflect criticism on his COVID-19 response and attack Vice President [Joe] Biden to try to make the election a choice between the two of them \u2014 rather than a referendum on coronavirus,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\n\u201c \u2018I think the next 3-6 weeks could see the most meaningful decline since the March 23 bear market bottom. If that\u2019s the case, the Dow should breach its May low and head to 22,000 at a minimum.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Paul Schatz, the president of Heritage Capital\n\nOther strategists make the case that the U.S. is likely to rework its supply chains away from China, on the heels of its phase-one trade agreement. If that is to be believed then the continuing China strife may be less of impact, some speculate.\n\n\u201cMy view has been and continues to be that we will launch an aggressive plan to rebuild supply chains over here (along with infrastructure spending),\u201d Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities, explained to MarketWatch.\n\n\u201cSo, from a markets standpoint I think partly noise, but more because we will be heading away from China anyway,\u201d he said.\n\nReworking supply chains may assume that the global economy returns to some semblance of normalcy in the wake of the world-wide public-health crisis.\n\nIn any case, Paul Schatz, the president of Heritage Capital, told MarketWatch that investors should brace for an equity slump in the next few weeks that could be triggered by disappointment about reopening the economy or some other catalyst.\n\n\u201cI think the next 3-6 weeks could see the most meaningful decline since the March 23 bear market bottom. If that\u2019s the case, the Dow should breach its May low and head to 22,000 at a minimum,\u201d he said.\n\nThat said, Schatz is upbeat on the market over the longer term and predicts that the Dow will hit 30,000 and the overall market will be \u201cdouble-digits higher\u201d in the coming 9-12 month period.\n\nAs for China, Schatz says he believes Trump is unlikely to jeopardize deepening the economic pain the U.S. is facing by locking horns with his counterpart President Xi Jinping.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Trump et al will do anything to further jeopardize the economy and what will be a nascent recovery. In other words, I think this is just saber rattling for the most part,\u201d\n\nStock-market bulls are betting that he\u2019s right."}, "no_of_news": 3, "plot_name": "/content/indices_plots/^GSPC.png"}}}
